pyax
(that's "pie-axe," not "pee-yaks," "puh-yaks" or other nonsense)

IMPORTANT!
This project is nearing the end of its overhaul. 

Specifically:

1) it's been renamed pyax
2) it's been moved to use Simon Fell's beatbox (which, in turn, uses xmltramp) 
   instead of SOAPpy (which has been abandoned)
3) it has been updated to Apex API 12.0. 
4) heavy refactoring to make it more PEP8 sane, except where we refer to Apex 
   calls/objects in their standard style
5) it's been moved to launchpad.net: https://launchpad.net/pyax
6) it is now licensed under GPLv2 rather than the BSD license due to the 
   change to beatbox/xmltramp

So... If you're looking to use this project, I suggest, at present, that you 
get the latest on the release branch from https://launchpad.net/pyax

Requirements:

Python 2.4.x or 2.5.x
NOTE: dependence on pytz (world timezone definitions for python) has been 
eliminated, but may still be desired in development work using pyax 


Installation:

(Assumes that user's shell is bash. Modify commands for setting environment 
vars accordingly if using another shell)

1) in bin, run "run_all_tests" (this runs against the copy in the source tree)

	$ cd .../pyax/bin
    $ ./run_all_tests
    
2) Install pyax somwhere in your PYTHONPATH:
 
    $ python setup.py install [--prefix=<DIR IN PYATHONPATH>]

3) Use it! Some examples on operations with pyax are in demo script, demo.py
   in the tests directory. Also demo can be run:
   
 	$ cd .../pyax/bin
    $ ./demo
