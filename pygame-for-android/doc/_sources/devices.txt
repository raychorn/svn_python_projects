Supported Devices
=================

Generally, the Pygame Subset for Android supports smartphones and
tablets supporting Android 2.0 or later. Games run far better if the
device has hardware OpenGL support.

We test new releases of the Pygame Subset for Android on the following
devices:

* Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant (SGH-T959)
* Motorola Xoom Wifi 

We've had community reports that the Pygame Subset for Android works
on:

* Samsung Galaxy Tab (thanks Tony Santiago)
* Nexus S (thanks Ben Michie)
* Nexus One (thanks Valentine Blacker)

If you'd like to add a device to one of these lists, please email
