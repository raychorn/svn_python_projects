Some random remarks:

(FS) ... Franz Steinhauesler
(AB) ... Antonio Barbosa

by Franz Steinhaeusler:

Priority 1 (highest):
  - test on linux ("segmentation fault" happens often on program exit)
  - make some controls more userfriendly, as in windows on gtk.
      listctrl, listbox, combobox should have more keyboard support.
  - tackle the bug entries on sourceforge.
  - default prefs: use spaces (PEP 263) and use wx.Filemanager.
  - some problems in findautocomplete plugin on gtk.
  - a user reported about problems in UTF-8.
  - put edit scripts to DrScript Menu?
  - put edit bookmarsk to Bookmarks Menu?
  - after close file, the active tab should be the one on the right side (now it is the one on the left side)
      for that I made a script, but it should be default behaviour.

Priority 2 (would be useful):
  - update doku for new plugins
  - correct the find procedure, sometimes a string is not found, althought
      it is in the text. I have to track it down, when it happens.
      Most often that happens, when changing the text (paste, delete) and then do a search next or previous.
      Simplyfing the procedure.
  - add "Posititon Marker" to the core (most programs have it by default).

Priority 3 (when time):
  - tackle the feature request entries on sourceforge.
  - use icons from tango project (already three people gave me that hint).
  - Add a "What's new" to DrPyhton help (if a say 1.66 is released, it should show all new features/fixes in that 
      version. A more button could show previous changes.
  - split export/import files to drscrips, drplugins and preferences as it was before.
  
Priority 4 (when much time):
  - add a function (Check for updates on drpython) (automatically and/or manually (setup switch))
  - add a function (Check for updates on plugins) (automatically and/or manually (setup switch))
  - install plugins from sourceforge
  - assign plugin shortcuts right away?

Priority 5(lowest):
  - download and install plugins or core automatically, if a update is found.
  - write a second "SearchInFiles" (a simple one) and add it to the core.
