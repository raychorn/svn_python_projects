You need to enable dev mode by opening a Terminal and typing:

defaults write com.apple.Dashboard devmode YES

then press Return, logout and log back in again. 

To get a widget off of the Dashboard and onto your desktop, just do the following: 

- Activate Dashboard by pressing F12 (or whatever key you've assigned to Dashboard). 
- Begin dragging the widget. 
- Press F12 again, before letting go of the mouse button and drop the widget wherever you want.

You can repeat this for as many widgets as you like.



Enable:

defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES && killall Dock

Disable:

defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode NO && killall Dock

me:I am trying to log into MySQL on 10.100.162.44, is this still the MySQL Server for Bouyges ?
Luis Ramos:yes
Luis Ramos:you need credentials?
me:Do you know the MySQL username/password I should be using ?
me:It says analytics_admin@localhost is failing for me since I am getting there via SSH.
me:I need MySQL Admin Credentials for localhost... PLS. 
Luis Ramos:you can use root if you logged in as root, but technically we have a user ""analytics_admin"" (gyd82jd) and ""analytics_portal"" (gyd82jd) with same database names.
Luis Ramos:sec
me:Yes, but from the localhost perspective, this is what I need.
Luis Ramos:if you log in as root, just do ""mysql -u root"", oh, you're trying to access mysql remotely? or localhost, let me find the password.

I'm implementing API of Amazon Cloud Drive with Python. I can upload and download files, can also operate folders. I will release full-implemented code until early May.

PyAmazonCloudDrive (pyacd)

test.py http://code.google.com/p/pyamazonclouddrive/source/browse/trunk/test.py

READ CAREFULLY : FOR MASTER COLLECTION : WINDOWS : 1. / Install Adobe Master Collection 2. / Use XFORCE keygen to generate your serial 3. / When installation is finished Execute disable_activation.cmd from Win folder(double click on it) (in vista or Win7, run it as admin if you have uac enabled) 4. / Enjoy it 5. / Check WIN / install_color_finesse3_osx.txt to install Color Finesse 3 NB: If you have problem with authentification when you launch the application check your %windir% \ system32 \ drivers \ etc \ hosts file and make sure there is a line like this one : 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

If not add it manually. But it shouldnt be required if you followed our installation procedure. MACOSX : 1. / Install Adobe Master Collection 2. / Use XFORCE keygen to generate your serial on a windows machine 3. / When installation is finished Run Osx /disable_activation_osx as root if you dont know how to do that, open a terminal window then issue sudo -s, a root shell will open then simply do ""sh disable_activation_osx"" w / o the """" or . /disable_activation_osx( make it executable chmod 755 disable_activation_osx you do that from the folder where disable_activation_osx is. (just copy it anywhere on your hdd) 4. / Enjoy it 5. / Check OSX / install_color_finesse3_osx.txt to install Color Finesse 3 NB : if you have problems with authentification when you start application, check the file /etc / hosts and make sure you have a like like this : 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com If you dont add it manually. Open a terminal and use your favourite editor you must do that as root example (after opening a terminal window) : sudo pico / etc / hosts then at request put your root password

All I need is the opportunity to get my foot in the door without being faced with those who cannot believe without proof when there can be no proof until I am hired.

Programming tests are a huge bore...

Overly simplistic coding exorcises on a whiteboard are demeaning...

Pair Programming is a complete waste of my professional time and talent...

Code Reviews are useful only to limit what I might do to the skill level of those who might be asked to look at my code...

Hoping this makes sense.

The kinds of problems I routinely knock out of the park, so to speak, are the kinds of problems your typical run-of-the-mill programmer won't be able to begin to deal with... 

Case in point, Hyper-Fast Geotagging for BigData (HADOOP) without the need for any trig functions (aka Haversine, this is not the replacement of certain trig functions with their non-trig analogs) - this is a big deal for BigData shops that want to do something with their PetaBytes of Geotagged data... You won't get any useful information from Google in this regard. In fact, almost nobody else has solved this problem in the exact specific manner that I have let alone even be aware of it other than to replace trig functions with non-trig analogs... I developed a useful working algorithm right off the top of my head... and it works ! When I say ""Hyper-Fast"" I mean really fast as-in ""man, that was fast..."". But then when you have 10+ terabytes of data to sift through quickly and you want to splash some data onto a Map using GPS Coordinates you need a Hyper-Fast method for determining exactly which 30 foot by 40 foot area each data element is associated with; this also works with larger areas, for instance - the size of the area is not important and does not have any impact on the performance of my method. (Please don't ask for a Tutorial or detailed explanation of my technique... spend some time learning what Haversines are and how to locate data elements with a region on a map - sounds simple until you have to sift through millions or billions of rows of data...)

Additionally, I have created a Real-Time Method for performing Data Aggregations for BigData. The amount of data is NOT important for this method for any case other than the initial scan to collect the initial Data Aggregation Set. This is a big deal for Analytics, obviously.

Let's not gloss-over the value in being able to make BigData handle data FAST !!!  

Also let's not gloss-over my technical skills... very few software design houses can push complete software products from start to finish in less than 6 months however I was able to do this for AmazingFacts.Org (1 Product on 2 Platforms, Windows and Mac, in 2 Languages, Spanish and English, in less than 4 months based on a completely functional prototype that came together during the initial 30 hours... Obviously I like to reward those who can engage me based on a minimal process rather than those who require proof based on how I might talk about what I do...)

Let's talk about Mobile Development for Android and iOS. Android is the winner and Apple is playing catch-up. My idea of Mobile Development is a reusable Framework for Android and iOS that allows me to deploy the same core code to Android of iOS with a matching App for the Desktop and I mean ALL Desktops (Windows + Mac + Linux) using the same core code with Native Look and Feel for every deployment and Native code for Android and iOS. I go one step further by leveraging the Cloud for Distributed Processing and Distributed Data. This allows my customers to go Mobile when they want to and Desktop when they want to all using the same data with seamless transition from Mobile to Desktop and back.

Let's talk about Cloud Computing... I like to leverage the Google App Engine (GAE) because I can do so at virtually NO COST by blending-in a number of Cloud-based Service Providers including but not limited to Amazon EC2 (great for low-cost VM-based distributed-data distributed-computing needs) and others. In more than 2+ years I have never had to pay for my use of GAE. I also like to use a standard Cloud Processing Framework I can deploy everywhere using the same core code with only minor modifications based on the specific platform of choice whether that be GAE or Amazon EC2.

Let's talk Virtualization... I like to deploy robust Linux-based servers and systems that leverage Virtualization to the extent possible. The proper use of Virtualization can make deployments both easier and more robust. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) forms the base of all my preferred systems mixed with XenServer and XenCenter or the like because as we all know one server can do many things and Virtualization makes big servers run like a bunch of smaller servers all working together. Virtualization also makes all my own deployments more robust as flexible by empowering me to cruise ahead to the next solution and the next set of very happy customers.

I seek to exceed the expectations of those who engage me and I always hit that mark with flying colors.  Just ask the folks at AmazingFacts.Org for whom I developed 1 Product for Windows and Mac in English and Spanish in under 4 months with a fully functional prototype in 30 hours.  These days I am completing my first Android App in 2-3 weeks with more Apps to follow at the rate of 1 per week or 1 per weekend.

When pulling up the menu bar for the app, the ""Exit"" button is disabled, and when looking at running apps via the Kindle ""Applications"" setting, the app does not show up under ""Running Applications"". Net-net, there's not an easy way to quit the app to reload an updated XML file. (Can we enable the exit button in the menu?)

(1) The App exits RAM when the user hits the Home or Back buttons - I have checked this myself to make sure this is happening however I can enable the Exit button via funded development time. 1 hr (Development and testing)

When showing an image, the title bar says ""Cisco Amazon Kindle Fire Demo v0.8.0 :: Viewing ""tab1"" 1 of 8"" - can this be removed so we only see the image we are displaying.

(2) I can check to see if this can be done however it will require 1 hour of funded development time.


I've loaded two images (the two screen shots I sent you the other day) to test the app - although I can see the first one, no amount of clicking, advances me to the next image. (My XML file may be off - still checking on that).

(3)  XML issues will continue to be a problem however Cisco has the option of funding more development time if they wish - I recommend they request a Desktop-based Builder App which would require an additional 100 hours of development.


(4) I could whip-up some Builder functions for the Kindle for 150 hours of development time. (I have actually done this work already however I had to spend 150 hours to make this work).


When the Nav bar is shown, clicking on a navigation button hides the nav bar - the nav bar should explicitly remain until it's toggled off.

(5) I could make this an option via the XML file for 2-3 hours of funded development time.

Finally, could you also please provide some documentation on the XML syntax - what each tag does, and perhaps a sample (""hello, world"") XML file or two.




(6) I have passed several sample files to Dave however he really needs a Builder App either for the Desktop (Windows or Mac) or Android (see my estimates above for the development time required).

4fde144970c8021ce4006261,"I am not sure I can adequately explain just why the following companies felt the need to reduce their head-count when they did however I did everything in my power to ensure I was keeping my job(s) until the very end:

Big Fix, Inc. - hired as a perm employee but their primary customer upon which they received a great deal of revenue was CountryWide, it should be easy to see why this company laid-off a huge number of perm employees of which I was one.  BigFix was later bought my IBM and the BigFix products are being converted into IBM Product Offerings.
Magma Design Automation - hired as a contractor and won my perm employee role after 6 long months as a contractor; my mother was busy dying however I remained on the job working to keep my job through every single wave of lay-offs right until there were exactly 2 employees left in my department and then I was laid-off - I also took several pay-cuts to keep my job during this period.  The fact that I was willing to take several cuts in my salary and I had to listen to my siblings tell me about my mother's final days in the hospital rather than go and see her myself proves I am more than loyal to those who have chosen to employ me and while I may not ever get another opportunity to have to visit my mother I did remain employed for as long as possible in this and every other situation in which I have ever been employed.
Smith Micro - hired as a contractor, created several unique problem solutions and was asked to go perm however I had to wait until the cost to be taken perm was reduced and during this time Smith Micro announced a major lay-off on or about the end of Oct 2011 - I kept my contracting job right up until 20% of all perm employees were laid-off.
I have proven my value as a Senior Software Engineer.

I am not the one who has chosen to cut any of my employment engagements short.

50211a1c70c802409d002909,"Hi Ray,

There is a scenario wherein when multiple devices are mapped to a device, if one of the device is in ""offline"" state.Then an error gets generated for this particular device and then a purchase order gets generated for the other devices.

Clarification required from business : Is requirement of the business to ""not process"" the purchase order at all, even if one of the mapped device of the SSL cert is invalid ?

else

If the requirement is to just move the error after the purchase order, then that can be implemented from ""MyRack"" team only. As once the renewal order is triggered, the code control is transferred to ""MyRack"" portal and we will not be able to update the ticket with error right after the ""Purchase order"" ( as the purchase order gets printed from ""MyRack"" team and not by us).

o	Keep me posted as to your assessment of the problem and how you plan to resolve.
•	LAM-912 - Churn forecast category list edition in UI. - Need more clarity on this issue, as to where the UI needs to be added (we are guessing it to be Churn forecast admin tool), input fields of the UI, etc. We have now identified the files that need code changes. Need more clarity on the business requirements.
o	I was under the impression the problem was in how MRR values are being displayed in the Admin Tool…  Can you give me some additional details as to your assessment of the problem and how to resolve same ?
•	LAM-909 - We are not sure how to reproduce the scenario of auto-generation of accounts. Need inputs on the same.

LAM-907 - Churn forecast MRR mismatch issue - Analysis in progress
o    Keep me posted as to your assessment of the problem and how you plan to resolve.
The front-end summary page displays the MRR value from a table in core, but in the details page the value is getting displayed based on the inputs from some text fields ( we are still trying to figure out how the values are being obtained for this). So the main problem about this issue is that the values from the ""Summary"" page and that of the ""details"" page are not in sync. We were able to reproduce this scenario by first selecting a reason for churn forecast giving its MRR as $75  and then editing the same ""Churnforecast"" by choosing the category as ""downgrade"" ( in latter case the MRR by default becomes ""0"" in the details page whereas the summary page MRR still remains as $75). We will keep you posted on this
One approach might be to focus on what is required to make the UI appear to be working then work on how your newly written code might be broken and then run some test cases to determine if the code you wrote that might fix this issue actually fixes this issue.  Hoping this might be of some use to you during your anslysis.


LAM-912 - Churn forecast category list edition in UI. - Need more clarity on this issue, as to where the UI needs to be added (we are guessing it to be Churn forecast admin tool), input fields of the UI, etc. We have now identified the files that need code changes.

o    
I was under the impression the problem was in how MRR values are being displayed in the Admin Tool…  Can you give me some additional details as to your assessment of the problem and how to resolve same ?
This issue was actually for providing exceptions to certain categories from a ""30-day window period"" that needs to be provided to the clients before taking their devices offline. Currently they are being done by harcoding these categories in the code, rather they want a UI from where they can edit the categories that can be exempted from the 30-day grace period.
Okay, I was thinking about LAM-907, thanks for the correction.

So it seems you need clarification as to the specific Categories they want ?  If this is the case then I would say code some dummy categories while I work on the requirements.

Then it seems you may be on track with learning how to fix this issue.  Find-out why the following corrects the issue: (learning this might lead to a fix)

David Pope and Jim Albert dropped-by to talk about a new task for the offshore developers.

(1). Pick 2 offshore developers who can work with  ServiceNow, the Rackspace Ticketing System.

(2). Work with these 2 offshore developers as-needed to support their efforts.

Goals:

(1). Determine which tickets are bugs from those that are enhancement requests; research tickets to determine the cause of the issue and make a determination.

(2). Enhancement Requests are handled differently than bug requests - enhancements are to be kicked-out of the queue.

Per David Hopkins last Friday about the business logic in case –

1)	Both first name and last name has only special characters
Logic – default “Admin – ABC” can be the UserId
2)	If the first name and last name has some special characters
Logic – userid = first letter of first name+ last name
**Condition – minimum 3 characters should be in User Id 
3)	In case the first name and last name has alphabets less than 3, the user id will still be default id – “Admin – ABC”

All the use cases above are not possible to happen, but we should have logic built in place to capture those (just in case)

** Stealth Startup, via Vyper Logix Corp, working to build their Alpha Site capable of matching Shippers with Cargo Carriers for future equity. Successfully changed technology expectations away from PHP in favor of Python/Django.   Just to wet your appetite for my skills...  I recently built a Python/Django/nginx/tornado/wsgi site for one of the startups I am working to support for future equity and it all runs in Ubuntu 12.04 hosted with Amazon/EC2 and 2 other providers at the same time; I had no problems deploying this site to all 3 providers. (See also: http://cargochief.vyperlogix.com <--- I am the Lead Developer who is also handling 100% of the I.T. Infrastructure as well as leading the development effort.)

** Reverse Engineered the Google Search Engine - now I can show you using any Whiteboard how you too can craft your own Google Search Engine by leveraging the Real-time Data Processing Pattern.

Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex Adobe Flash performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques others seem unable to use when they should.

Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex HADOOP performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques I have been using for many years for my own projects.

Experience gives me the ability to use the same files and the same data when deploying applications and services for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS even when these operating systems appear to be very different for most people - all these operating systems work exactly the same for me and the code I routinely write.  Write the code once and deploy everywhere, this is what I bring to the table.

Experience gives me the ability to optimize the handling of billions or trillions of GPS Coordinates for the purpose of handling real-time updates for Analytics Systems that feature Map-based displays of aggregations of data based on all those GPS Coordinates.

Experience gives me the ability to reverse-engineer the Google Search Engine, without ever having to see their code, just by observation and conjecture.  Ask me to tell you all about this once you have hired me.

Experience gives me the ability to deploy H.264 Streaming Video Apps for Android with much less effort than those who seek to use more traditional development methods.

I have current start-up experience and have worked for several start-ups during my career.

506b0b8270c8022030224fd3,"Not only can I build Django Apps but I can also deploy them - let me tell you the former is much easier than the latter since the latter requires some fairly intense systems-level knowledge.

I have better than average Python skills and not only because I have a working Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx server deployed; I also know how to scale this beast by way of automation in the Amazon Cloud using EC2 instances.  BTW Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+IIS7 works just as easily for Windows as Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx works for Linux but then I can also do Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx for Windows too.   

 I have also been doing native Django in the Google App Engine; native Django is different than the typical Django Google chose to include with the Google App Engine - by native I mean just that, the same Django App you might run outside the Google App Engine also works inside the Google App Engine - NATIVE !!!

I was able to very quickly produce this code during the same time the Interviewer had difficulties making his code work.

Just a small sample of what I can do.

100% REMOTE OFFSITE for only $55/hr c2c or an equivalent salary.

I can do this same thing with Java, JavaScript, AS3, ColdFusion, Scala, Ruby, Ant or any other language found in my Resume; just sharing what I can do given my level of professional maturity in the Agile Software Development Process.

Keep in mind, I am Agile ( http://wp.me/Pdk8l-h1 ) and Certified.

Coded an interactive multimedia Safari Extension capable of playing a PowerPoint-like Slideshow containing various media types including H.264 Videos and Images with Sound.  Also produced this same user experience for Android and iOS as well as traditional Desktops running Windows/Mac/Linux.

The user was able to use one or more fingers to swipe from video to video just as though the user was standing in a video control room.  Users were also able to use an iOS device to pan from video to video by moving their device in space with their hand in much the same manner as people who are familiar with Google Sky that shows stars and other celestial bodies by moving an Android device in space by using one's hands.

506cab4e0731a301a55a1ab3,"I do Next-Generation Android development that allows me to do the following with complete ease:

I have done video playback with Android for Cisco and I did not bother with the technology stack in which you have interest because the development time was 

The Cisco Systems Project had the following features:

* H.264 Streaming Video Playback from YouTube and other sources.
* Local Video Playback from Android Device.
* MP3 Playback both Streamed and Local.
* Microsoft PowerPoint Playback Model with ability to pick and choose the next Slide to be played.

This was a non-trivial project due to the sheer number of features and the goals as outlined by Cisco Systems.

It would NOT have been possible to do any of this in anything less than 6 man-months otherwise.

This is the benefit of having the experience versus those who clearly don't.   Those who don't have the experience will want to do this video playback thing using old-school techniques and they will always spend 10x more time banging their heads against a brick-wall until they are done - eventually.  Those who know what they are doing will just do it and get on to the next thing using far less effort than the rest.

I was paid $100/hr c2c for the Cisco Systems Project plus another $20k bonus upon completion.

100% REMOTE OFFSITE for only $55/hr c2c or an equivalent salary.

Keep in mind, I am Agile ( http://wp.me/Pdk8l-h1 ) and Certified.

I am most available after 3p PDT M-F via 415-314-5967 (cell); my availability increases the greater the distance from 3p PDT.

Oracle can shard but still each shard has an upper limit that's not high enough...

Look those over. They are great. Especially TimeLive Local. If you use Firefox you will need the Greasemonkey extension. If you use Chrome you may need the Tampermonkey extension to make them work. Open Parser is another great script. It will let you track and find players anywhere and anytime.

These tools are extremely important. USE THEM! If you are a NPC attacker only, Open Parser isn't as important, but Battlement and BattleCalc are. 

-BattleMentat is a great Combat Calculator. The best in my opinion. It will tell you almost anything you want to know about the attack. A downside is that if you play on your phone it doesn't seem to want to work if you have a Iphone. Works better with Android i think. 
http://www.battlementat.com/#universe=stardrift 

-Battlecalc is a older Combat Calculator but is still useful. It works ok, but seems to get a little off with huge fleets and when Zeus or Titan ships are involved. But it does work. The big plus is it works on phones well. 
http://www.battlecalc.com/ 

-OpenParser will help you find and track enemies. An amazing tool if you know how to use it.

You need to enable dev mode by opening a Terminal and typing:

defaults write com.apple.Dashboard devmode YES

then press Return, logout and log back in again. 

To get a widget off of the Dashboard and onto your desktop, just do the following: 

- Activate Dashboard by pressing F12 (or whatever key you've assigned to Dashboard). 
- Begin dragging the widget. 
- Press F12 again, before letting go of the mouse button and drop the widget wherever you want.

You can repeat this for as many widgets as you like.



Enable:

defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES && killall Dock

me:Do you know the MySQL username/password I should be using ?
me:It says analytics_admin@localhost is failing for me since I am getting there via SSH.
me:I need MySQL Admin Credentials for localhost... PLS. 
Luis Ramos:you can use root if you logged in as root, but technically we have a user ""analytics_admin"" (gyd82jd) and ""analytics_portal"" (gyd82jd) with same database names.
Luis Ramos:sec
me:Yes, but from the localhost perspective, this is what I need.
Luis Ramos:if you log in as root, just do ""mysql -u root"", oh, you're trying to access mysql remotely? or localhost, let me find the password.

me:I am using SSH to connect to MySQL as though I was using it locally... so MySQL thinks I am analytics_admin@localhost but it may not know that username...

READ CAREFULLY : FOR MASTER COLLECTION : WINDOWS : 1. / Install Adobe Master Collection 2. / Use XFORCE keygen to generate your serial 3. / When installation is finished Execute disable_activation.cmd from Win folder(double click on it) (in vista or Win7, run it as admin if you have uac enabled) 4. / Enjoy it 5. / Check WIN / install_color_finesse3_osx.txt to install Color Finesse 3 NB: If you have problem with authentification when you launch the application check your %windir% \ system32 \ drivers \ etc \ hosts file and make sure there is a line like this one : 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

If not add it manually. But it shouldnt be required if you followed our installation procedure. MACOSX : 1. / Install Adobe Master Collection 2. / Use XFORCE keygen to generate your serial on a windows machine 3. / When installation is finished Run Osx /disable_activation_osx as root if you dont know how to do that, open a terminal window then issue sudo -s, a root shell will open then simply do ""sh disable_activation_osx"" w / o the """" or . /disable_activation_osx( make it executable chmod 755 disable_activation_osx you do that from the folder where disable_activation_osx is. (just copy it anywhere on your hdd) 4. / Enjoy it 5. / Check OSX / install_color_finesse3_osx.txt to install Color Finesse 3 NB : if you have problems with authentification when you start application, check the file /etc / hosts and make sure you have a like like this : 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com If you dont add it manually.

Available:  2 weeks or less from acceptance of assignment and paperwork has been signed and vetting process is compete.

All I need is the opportunity to get my foot in the door without being faced with those who cannot believe without proof when there can be no proof until I am hired.

Programming tests are a huge bore...

Overly simplistic coding exorcises on a whiteboard are demeaning...

Pair Programming is a complete waste of my professional time and talent...

Code Reviews are useful only to limit what I might do to the skill level of those who might be asked to look at my code...

Hoping this makes sense.

The kinds of problems I routinely knock out of the park, so to speak, are the kinds of problems your typical run-of-the-mill programmer won't be able to begin to deal with... 

Case in point, Hyper-Fast Geotagging for BigData (HADOOP) without the need for any trig functions (aka Haversine, this is not the replacement of certain trig functions with their non-trig analogs) - this is a big deal for BigData shops that want to do something with their PetaBytes of Geotagged data... You won't get any useful information from Google in this regard. In fact, almost nobody else has solved this problem in the exact specific manner that I have let alone even be aware of it other than to replace trig functions with non-trig analogs... I developed a useful working algorithm right off the top of my head... and it works ! When I say ""Hyper-Fast"" I mean really fast as-in ""man, that was fast..."". But then when you have 10+ terabytes of data to sift through quickly and you want to splash some data onto a Map using GPS Coordinates you need a Hyper-Fast method for determining exactly which 30 foot by 40 foot area each data element is associated with; this also works with larger areas, for instance - the size of the area is not important and does not have any impact on the performance of my method. (Please don't ask for a Tutorial or detailed explanation of my technique... spend some time learning what Haversines are and how to locate data elements with a region on a map - sounds simple until you have to sift through millions or billions of rows of data...)

Additionally, I have created a Real-Time Method for performing Data Aggregations for BigData. The amount of data is NOT important for this method for any case other than the initial scan to collect the initial Data Aggregation Set. This is a big deal for Analytics, obviously.

Let's not gloss-over the value in being able to make BigData handle data FAST !!!  

Also let's not gloss-over my technical skills... very few software design houses can push complete software products from start to finish in less than 6 months however I was able to do this for AmazingFacts.Org (1 Product on 2 Platforms, Windows and Mac, in 2 Languages, Spanish and English, in less than 4 months based on a completely functional prototype that came together during the initial 30 hours... Obviously I like to reward those who can engage me based on a minimal process rather than those who require proof based on how I might talk about what I do...)

Let's talk about Mobile Development for Android and iOS. Android is the winner and Apple is playing catch-up. My idea of Mobile Development is a reusable Framework for Android and iOS that allows me to deploy the same core code to Android of iOS with a matching App for the Desktop and I mean ALL Desktops (Windows + Mac + Linux) using the same core code with Native Look and Feel for every deployment and Native code for Android and iOS. I go one step further by leveraging the Cloud for Distributed Processing and Distributed Data. This allows my customers to go Mobile when they want to and Desktop when they want to all using the same data with seamless transition from Mobile to Desktop and back.

Let's talk about Cloud Computing... I like to leverage the Google App Engine (GAE) because I can do so at virtually NO COST by blending-in a number of Cloud-based Service Providers including but not limited to Amazon EC2 (great for low-cost VM-based distributed-data distributed-computing needs) and others. In more than 2+ years I have never had to pay for my use of GAE. I also like to use a standard Cloud Processing Framework I can deploy everywhere using the same core code with only minor modifications based on the specific platform of choice whether that be GAE or Amazon EC2.

Let's talk Virtualization... I like to deploy robust Linux-based servers and systems that leverage Virtualization to the extent possible. The proper use of Virtualization can make deployments both easier and more robust. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) forms the base of all my preferred systems mixed with XenServer and XenCenter or the like because as we all know one server can do many things and Virtualization makes big servers run like a bunch of smaller servers all working together. Virtualization also makes all my own deployments more robust as flexible by empowering me to cruise ahead to the next solution and the next set of very happy customers.

The way I develop my own Apps causes my effective bill rate about 10% or less of whatever would be paid to anyone else who might be asked to do the same level of work.  I seek to exceed the expectations of those who engage me and I always hit that mark with flying colors.  Just ask the folks at AmazingFacts.Org for whom I developed 1 Product for Windows and Mac in English and Spanish in under 4 months with a fully functional prototype in 30 hours.  These days I am completing my first Android App in 2-3 weeks with more Apps to follow at the rate of 1 per week or 1 per weekend.  My Android Apps will have a matching Desktop App for Windows, Mac and Linux using the same core code with a slightly different look and feel for the traditional Desktop versions.

When pulling up the menu bar for the app, the ""Exit"" button is disabled, and when looking at running apps via the Kindle ""Applications"" setting, the app does not show up under ""Running Applications"". Net-net, there's not an easy way to quit the app to reload an updated XML file. (Can we enable the exit button in the menu?)

(1) The App exits RAM when the user hits the Home or Back buttons - I have checked this myself to make sure this is happening however I can enable the Exit button via funded development time. 1 hr (Development and testing)

When showing an image, the title bar says ""Cisco Amazon Kindle Fire Demo v0.8.0 :: Viewing ""tab1"" 1 of 8"" - can this be removed so we only see the image we are displaying.

(2) I can check to see if this can be done however it will require 1 hour of funded development time.


I've loaded two images (the two screen shots I sent you the other day) to test the app - although I can see the first one, no amount of clicking, advances me to the next image. (My XML file may be off - still checking on that).

(3)  XML issues will continue to be a problem however Cisco has the option of funding more development time if they wish - I recommend they request a Desktop-based Builder App which would require an additional 100 hours of development.


(4) I could whip-up some Builder functions for the Kindle for 150 hours of development time. (I have actually done this work already however I had to spend 150 hours to make this work).


When the Nav bar is shown, clicking on a navigation button hides the nav bar - the nav bar should explicitly remain until it's toggled off.

(5) I could make this an option via the XML file for 2-3 hours of funded development time.

Finally, could you also please provide some documentation on the XML syntax - what each tag does, and perhaps a sample (""hello, world"") XML file or two.




(6) I have passed several sample files to Dave however he really needs a Builder App either for the Desktop (Windows or Mac) or Android (see my estimates above for the development time required).

* H.264 Streaming Video Playback from YouTube and other sources.
* Local Video Playback from Android Device.
* MP3 Playback both Streamed and Local.
* Microsoft PowerPoint Playback Model with ability to pick and choose the next Slide to be played.

This was a non-trivial project due to the sheer number of features and the goals as outlined by Cisco Systems.

It would NOT have been possible to do any of this in anything less than 6 man-months otherwise.

This is the benefit of having the experience versus those who clearly don't.   Those who don't have the experience will want to do this video playback thing using old-school techniques and they will always spend 10x more time banging their heads against a brick-wall until they are done - eventually.  Those who know what they are doing will just do it and get on to the next thing using far less effort than the rest.

Look those over. They are great. Especially TimeLive Local. If you use Firefox you will need the Greasemonkey extension. If you use Chrome you may need the Tampermonkey extension to make them work. Open Parser is another great script. It will let you track and find players anywhere and anytime.

These tools are extremely important. USE THEM! If you are a NPC attacker only, Open Parser isn't as important, but Battlement and BattleCalc are. 

-BattleMentat is a great Combat Calculator. The best in my opinion. It will tell you almost anything you want to know about the attack. A downside is that if you play on your phone it doesn't seem to want to work if you have a Iphone. Works better with Android i think. 
http://www.battlementat.com/#universe=stardrift 

-Battlecalc is a older Combat Calculator but is still useful. It works ok, but seems to get a little off with huge fleets and when Zeus or Titan ships are involved. But it does work. The big plus is it works on phones well. 
http://www.battlecalc.com/ 

-OpenParser will help you find and track enemies. An amazing tool if you know how to use it.

David Pope and Jim Albert dropped-by to talk about a new task for the offshore developers.

(1). Pick 2 offshore developers who can work with  ServiceNow, the Rackspace Ticketing System.

(2). Work with these 2 offshore developers as-needed to support their efforts.

Goals:

(1). Determine which tickets are bugs from those that are enhancement requests; research tickets to determine the cause of the issue and make a determination.

(2). Enhancement Requests are handled differently than bug requests - enhancements are to be kicked-out of the queue.

50211a1c70c802409d002909,"Hi Ray,

There is a scenario wherein when multiple devices are mapped to a device, if one of the device is in ""offline"" state.Then an error gets generated for this particular device and then a purchase order gets generated for the other devices.

Clarification required from business : Is requirement of the business to ""not process"" the purchase order at all, even if one of the mapped device of the SSL cert is invalid ?

else

If the requirement is to just move the error after the purchase order, then that can be implemented from ""MyRack"" team only. As once the renewal order is triggered, the code control is transferred to ""MyRack"" portal and we will not be able to update the ticket with error right after the ""Purchase order"" ( as the purchase order gets printed from ""MyRack"" team and not by us).

LAM-907 - Churn forecast MRR mismatch issue - Analysis in progress
o    Keep me posted as to your assessment of the problem and how you plan to resolve.
The front-end summary page displays the MRR value from a table in core, but in the details page the value is getting displayed based on the inputs from some text fields ( we are still trying to figure out how the values are being obtained for this). So the main problem about this issue is that the values from the ""Summary"" page and that of the ""details"" page are not in sync. We were able to reproduce this scenario by first selecting a reason for churn forecast giving its MRR as $75  and then editing the same ""Churnforecast"" by choosing the category as ""downgrade"" ( in latter case the MRR by default becomes ""0"" in the details page whereas the summary page MRR still remains as $75). We will keep you posted on this
One approach might be to focus on what is required to make the UI appear to be working then work on how your newly written code might be broken and then run some test cases to determine if the code you wrote that might fix this issue actually fixes this issue.  Hoping this might be of some use to you during your anslysis.


LAM-912 - Churn forecast category list edition in UI. - Need more clarity on this issue, as to where the UI needs to be added (we are guessing it to be Churn forecast admin tool), input fields of the UI, etc. We have now identified the files that need code changes.

o    
I was under the impression the problem was in how MRR values are being displayed in the Admin Tool…  Can you give me some additional details as to your assessment of the problem and how to resolve same ?
This issue was actually for providing exceptions to certain categories from a ""30-day window period"" that needs to be provided to the clients before taking their devices offline. Currently they are being done by harcoding these categories in the code, rather they want a UI from where they can edit the categories that can be exempted from the 30-day grace period.
Okay, I was thinking about LAM-907, thanks for the correction.

So it seems you need clarification as to the specific Categories they want ?  If this is the case then I would say code some dummy categories while I work on the requirements.

The front-end summary page displays the MRR value from a table in core, but in the details page the value is getting displayed based on the inputs from some text fields ( we are still trying to figure out how the values are being obtained for this). So the main problem about this issue is that the values from the ""Summary"" page and that of the ""details"" page are not in sync.

We will keep you posted on this

Then it seems you may be on track with learning how to fix this issue.  Find-out why the following corrects the issue: (learning this might lead to a fix)

LAM-868		As requested tester scripts have been emailed to deploy in staging

--> Requested the python script in addition to the shell script...

--> Scripts have been sent to the Application Support Team via Lauren Luensmann.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
LAM-907		Pending clarification from client regarding the MRR update to CORE through Cloud system, yet to hear from BA, JIRA not updated and waiting for update.

--> Waiting to get more information via a meeting to be scheduled later this week.
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAM-909		Updated JIRA on the code review comments from Nadeem. Waiting for the response as well as how to reproduce the issue through XML RPC scenario. 

LAM-909:- Received comments from BA (Jyoti/David Hopkins) updated and tested code review links has been added with JIRA.
		
Per David Hopkins last Friday about the business logic in case –

1)	Both first name and last name has only special characters
Logic – default “Admin – ABC” can be the UserId
2)	If the first name and last name has some special characters
Logic – userid = first letter of first name+ last name
**Condition – minimum 3 characters should be in User Id 
3)	In case the first name and last name has alphabets less than 3, the user id will still be default id – “Admin – ABC”

All the use cases above are not possible to happen, but we should have logic built in place to capture those (just in case)

--> Trying to touch-base with Nadeem once we are done with our full-day Scrum Training this week.

--> Sent email to Haroon and Harish with some information for XMLRPC docs.

--> Ready for UAT and Peer Review

--> Peer Review Rejected !!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAM-912		Fix in progress, would be able to complete by Wednesday

--> Do we have any status for this item ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
LAM-914		Fix in progress from our side, seems Nadeem is also working and updating the code, need clarification. In case if he is working on the same then we can skip this?

--> Confirmed, Nadeem has a fix.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
LAM-920		Analysis in progress, clarifications emailed, waiting for the response 

LAM-920:- Mohinder is on leave due to personal emergency, would be able get more progress once he is back

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
LAM-922		In Peer review, Updated JIRA for the review comments from Andrew with consolidated peer review links

--> Checking with Rackspace to see how we can move this LAM through the process.

--> Finally in peer review !!!

--> Passed Peer Review !!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
LAM-924		Already there is a comment from Andrew stating the difficulty in reproducing the issue in DEV environment, need the inputs from him on this complexity that will support us and save our time. Updated to Ray, waiting for the response. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAM-924 has been reported already with an open LAM issue LAM-572 which is in development; please refer the comment pasted below(highlighted in yellow) from LAM-572 by Andrew

Dev Note: 

    Having difficulties performing testing in dev environments, slowing development down. 

- Andrew Dorrycott 

In case if LAM-572 code fix will address LAM-924 too then code fix for LAM-924 is not necessary I guess. Because the same issue described in LAM-924 has been stated in Lam-572 also (pasted below from 572 JIRA)

Sean Roberts added a comment - 15/Dec/11 09:03 AM 
Hallo - What happened with this? 

In analyzing queues we found that all the tickets with subject 'SSL Certificate Ordered' are listed as 'no OS' but they have OS tickets. Removing and re-assigning the ticket fixes the issue. 
		
Waiting for a presentation/demo running through the service now UI, detailing on the flows, covering functional aspects.

--> Waiting for Andrew Dorrycott to respond to my email(s) about this item.

* Workflows - Business Rules
* Scalability ($1 billion company to $5 billion company) 
* Organizational Efficiency
* Integrating phone, chat and social with mobile. (CRM)

Fix Core (Update Postgres and Update Python, etc) or Build Fresh Core.

Postgres is bad and Oracle is good.  Reason to rewrite from scratch.

Also created a Real-time Data Processing Pattern that works for all applications and uses including those that require the use of slower database platforms such as but not limited to HADOOP.  My Hyper-Fast Geo-tagging Algorithm does not use proximity detection as others in the industry tend to use in the form of the Haversines function.

** Stealth Startup, via Vyper Logix Corp, working to build their Alpha Site capable of matching Shippers with Cargo Carriers for future equity. Successfully changed technology expectations away from PHP in favor of Python/Django.   Just to wet your appetite for my skills...  I recently built a Python/Django/nginx/tornado/wsgi site for one of the startups I am working to support for future equity and it all runs in Ubuntu 12.04 hosted with Amazon/EC2 and 2 other providers at the same time; I had no problems deploying this site to all 3 providers. (See also: http://cargochief.vyperlogix.com <--- I am the Lead Developer who is also handling 100% of the I.T. Infrastructure as well as leading the development effort.)

** Reverse Engineered the Google Search Engine - now I can show you using any Whiteboard how you too can craft your own Google Search Engine by leveraging the Real-time Data Processing Pattern.

Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex Adobe Flash performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques others seem unable to use when they should.

Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex HADOOP performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques I have been using for many years for my own projects.

Experience gives me the ability to use the same files and the same data when deploying applications and services for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS even when these operating systems appear to be very different for most people - all these operating systems work exactly the same for me and the code I routinely write.  Write the code once and deploy everywhere, this is what I bring to the table.

Experience gives me the ability to optimize the handling of billions or trillions of GPS Coordinates for the purpose of handling real-time updates for Analytics Systems that feature Map-based displays of aggregations of data based on all those GPS Coordinates.

Experience gives me the ability to reverse-engineer the Google Search Engine, without ever having to see their code, just by observation and conjecture.  Ask me to tell you all about this once you have hired me.

Experience gives me the ability to deploy H.264 Streaming Video Apps for Android with much less effort than those who seek to use more traditional development methods.

I have current start-up experience and have worked for several start-ups during my career.

Big Fix, Inc. - hired as a perm employee but their primary customer upon which they received a great deal of revenue was CountryWide, it should be easy to see why this company laid-off a huge number of perm employees of which I was one.  BigFix was later bought my IBM and the BigFix products are being converted into IBM Product Offerings.
Magma Design Automation - hired as a contractor and won my perm employee role after 6 long months as a contractor; my mother was busy dying however I remained on the job working to keep my job through every single wave of lay-offs right until there were exactly 2 employees left in my department and then I was laid-off - I also took several pay-cuts to keep my job during this period.  The fact that I was willing to take several cuts in my salary and I had to listen to my siblings tell me about my mother's final days in the hospital rather than go and see her myself proves I am more than loyal to those who have chosen to employ me and while I may not ever get another opportunity to have to visit my mother I did remain employed for as long as possible in this and every other situation in which I have ever been employed.
Smith Micro - hired as a contractor, created several unique problem solutions and was asked to go perm however I had to wait until the cost to be taken perm was reduced and during this time Smith Micro announced a major lay-off on or about the end of Oct 2011 - I kept my contracting job right up until 20% of all perm employees were laid-off.
I have proven my value as a Senior Software Engineer.

I am not the one who has chosen to cut any of my employment engagements short.

506cab4e0731a301a55a1ab3,"I do Next-Generation Android development that allows me to do the following with complete ease:

I have done video playback with Android for Cisco and I did not bother with the technology stack in which you have interest because the development time was 

The Cisco Systems Project had the following features:

* H.264 Streaming Video Playback from YouTube and other sources.
* Local Video Playback from Android Device.
* MP3 Playback both Streamed and Local.
* Microsoft PowerPoint Playback Model with ability to pick and choose the next Slide to be played.

This was a non-trivial project due to the sheer number of features and the goals as outlined by Cisco Systems.

It would NOT have been possible to do any of this in anything less than 6 man-months otherwise.

This is the benefit of having the experience versus those who clearly don't.   Those who don't have the experience will want to do this video playback thing using old-school techniques and they will always spend 10x more time banging their heads against a brick-wall until they are done - eventually.  Those who know what they are doing will just do it and get on to the next thing using far less effort than the rest.

I was paid $100/hr c2c for the Cisco Systems Project plus another $20k bonus upon completion.

100% REMOTE OFFSITE for only $55/hr c2c or an equivalent salary.

506b0b8270c8022030224fd3,"Not only can I build Django Apps but I can also deploy them - let me tell you the former is much easier than the latter since the latter requires some fairly intense systems-level knowledge.

I have better than average Python skills and not only because I have a working Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx server deployed; I also know how to scale this beast by way of automation in the Amazon Cloud using EC2 instances.  BTW Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+IIS7 works just as easily for Windows as Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx works for Linux but then I can also do Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx for Windows too.   

 I have also been doing native Django in the Google App Engine; native Django is different than the typical Django Google chose to include with the Google App Engine - by native I mean just that, the same Django App you might run outside the Google App Engine also works inside the Google App Engine - NATIVE !!!
