====== Calendar ======

The Calendar Plugin adds calendar widget to zim. By default this is done by adding a calendar dialog, but optionally it can also be put in the side pane above the page index. In this calendar each date is linked to a page for that date. Pages for calendar dates are located under a specific namespace ("Calendar" by default, but this is configurable) which is subdivided by year and by month. Dates for which a page exists are marked in the calendar widget in bold.

In addition to the calendar widget, this plugin also adds an action to navigate to the page for the current date. 

This plugin is intended to help organize notes by date. It can for example be used to keep a journal. Another frequent use case is to put minutes of meetings or class notes on the page for the date of the meeting - possibly to work them out later in pages for the specific subject.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.
