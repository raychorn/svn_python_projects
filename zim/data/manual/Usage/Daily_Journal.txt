====== Daily Journal ======

You can use zim a journal notebook by using the calendar plugin.

If you want to mix the journal with other notes you can keep the journal pages in a separate namespace, like ':Calendar'. Or you can configure the top level namespace as the place to keep journal pages.

For a dedicated journal notebook you typically want to set the preference to have the calendar embedded in the side pane.
