====== Preferences ======

The preferences dialog  can be accessed with the menu item "//Edit//" -> "//Preferences//". The following options can be configured:

===== Interface =====
**Add 'tearoff' strips to the menu** adds a 'tearoff' strip to all menus in the menubar. This means that menus can be opened as small windows and stay open while editing a page.

**Use <Ctrl><Space> to switch to the side pane** toggles the key binding for <Ctrl><Space>. Reason to toggle this binding off is usually that this binding is also used for input methods for non-western scripts. The <Alt><Space> key binding can be used as an alternative if it is not already in use be e.g. the window manager.

**Use <Enter> to follow links** toggles the key binding to follow links inside a page. If disabled an <Enter> on a link will just be ignored. The <Alt><Enter> key binding can be used as an alternative.

**Show cursor for read-only pages** is used to toggle behavior of the cursor when a page can not be edited. By default the cursor is not visible when a page is read-only, but keyboard navigation is easier when the cursor is always visible.

**Use custom font** allows selecting a custom font for the editor window. This only applies to the page view itself, the font for all other interface elements is determined by the desktop theme.

===== Editing =====
**Automatically links "CamelCase" words** is used to enable or disable [[Auto Formatting|auto-linking]] CamelCase words.

**Automatically link files** is used to enable or disable [[Auto Formatting|auto-linking]] for file paths.

**Automatically select the current word** is used to enable or disable the feature where pressing e.g. <Ctrl><B> to toggle Bold formatting will automatically select the current word when the cursor is inside a word. The same option also controls whether toggling the format for a heading will select the whole line automatically.

**Unindent on <BackSpace>** toggles the key binding for the <BackSpace> key. If enabled the <BackSpace> key at the start of a indented line will unindent the line, if disabled the will delete the line break instead. The <Shift><Tab> key binding can be used as an alternative.

**Checking a checkbox also changes sub-items** toggles the behavior to make toggling checkboxes recursive. This feature makes sense for example for todo-lists but not necessarily for other kinds of lists.
