====== Compatibility ======


===== Changes from zim < 0.42 =====
We depend on Gtk+ >= 2.6 instead of >= 2.4

=== Config files ===
* ...
* Backward compatibility with files like notebook.list / repositories.list ?
* Removed profile options - use different XDG dirs if needed

=== Templates ===
* Templates now use "[%-" and "-%]" to remove linebreaks around tags

=== File links ===
* Dropped backward support for linking images in same namespace as dir with "./"  now only works with "../" while "./" is reserved for attachments.
* Made paths starting with '/' always refer to the document root. Absolute paths now always need the file:// syntax. (Only in the case where a notebook really doesn't have a directory will the document root default to the filesystem root.)
