====== Separate Window ======
Created Wednesday 23 December 2009

* Need to be able to manage multiple pageviews
	* make sure we handle all by signals
	* ui needs to track open pages instead of single page attribute -> check who accesses ui.page
	* pageviews should coordinate to use the same model if they open the same page
* Need class for secondairy window + own menubar / toolbar definition
* Need option to split the window (horizontal / vertical) - once or multiple times ?
* Need to decide up front how this combines with overloading pageview for special page types

Quick hack would be to have separate windows that are strictly read-only and open links in the main window.
