Storage
* IMap
* Mediawiki remote interface ?
* Dokuwiki RPC interface

Alternatively any storage that can be mounted through e.g. a fuse layer will just work out of the box. But may need to adjust directory layout details for other wiki types.

Pages are abstract enough that any remote storage will work. However we do not include a full file manager for attachments (yet). So to make a truly remote some work would be needed to manage remote attachments as well.

So we need to be able to deal with conflicts anyway. In that case checking content is not a bad idea. Have a notebook property to flag for backward compatibility and have a user visible property "all text files are pages" so peopel can choose depending on their usage. Woudl also need a one time upgrade action for old notebooks.
