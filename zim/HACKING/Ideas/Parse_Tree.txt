====== Parse Tree ======
Created Wednesday 23 December 2009

Make our internal format more HTML like. Still want to keep whitespace within paragraphs - encoding every extra space, tab and newline with an extra tag seems silly. So make every paragraph like a <pre>

However for spaces between paragraphs we maybe need to be more flexible - rendering html now gets too many additional <br> elements. Use hint for number of newlines like with perl version ? Have parsetree builder clean up redundant whitespace after heading etc. Wrap everything in para elements to make structure more clear. (and properly nest list elements)

How about indented part within a paragraph? Probably should use generic block element for this. Now it could be seen as a separate para, what is not necessarily what we want.

Also Use "i" and "b" instead of "emphasis" and "strong" ??
