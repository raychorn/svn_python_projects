====== Synchronization ======
Created Friday 18 December 2009

Multiple ways to do synchronisation
* Version control push / pull (bazaar, subversion, git ...)
* rsync, unison, ...
* email
* webmail (e.g. gmail)
* dedicated http / webdav server

The first two options are preferred because we can leave all the hassle of doing the actual sync or merge to a specialized program.

Would need a trigger to determine when to sync. Probably the same as for autosaving a version in version control. E.g. when leaving the program, daily, weekly, on an explicit user action.

Would like a generic plugin for this similar to versioncontrol and probably integrated with it when both are loaded. THe synchronization plugin could handle various backends.

Would be nice if we can syncronize by sending diffs to email. 
* You don't have to have a server online (and webmail accounts are cheap)
* If you can send the email through HTTP including proxy settings you can work from any network without to much hassle
I think bazaar can generate the diffs.
