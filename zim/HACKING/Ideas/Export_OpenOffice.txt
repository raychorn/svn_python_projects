====== Export OpenOffice ======
Created Wednesday 23 December 2009

* just zip file with XML, could handle it with etree library - but even easier as plain text
	* use template, open zip file, look for template instructions, fill them in
	* Need OO specific XML output - see: http://books.evc-cit.info/odbook/book.html

While at it create base class for import / export xml formats
* have a map with 1-to-1 translations
* allow methods for specific tags that need conversion logic
* import can ignore unknown tags (optional ?)
