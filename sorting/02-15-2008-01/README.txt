Purpose:
The purpose of this module is to provide the means to determine which sorting
algorithm scales-up with the best performance versus the number of items to
be sorted.

It should be noted that the built-in sort method found in Python is fastest
when the number of items to be sorted remains fairly small.  The persistent
sorting technique scales best when the number of items grows beyond the ability
to store the items in RAM otherwise consider using the built-in Python sorting
function as shown below in this code sample.
