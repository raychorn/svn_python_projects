So the main problem about this issue is that the values from the "Summary" page and that of the "details" page are not in sync. We were able to reproduce this scenario by first selecting a reason for churn forecast giving its MRR as $75  and then editing the same "Churnforecast" by choosing the category as "downgrade" ( in latter case the MRR by default becomes "0" in the details page whereas the summary page MRR still remains as $75). We will keep you posted on this<BR/>One approach might be to focus on what is required to make the UI appear to be working then work on how your newly written code might be broken and then run some test cases to determine if the code you wrote that might fix this issue actually fixes this issue.  Hoping this might be of some use to you during your anslysis.<BR/><BR/><BR/>LAM-912 - Churn forecast category list edition in UI. - Need more clarity on this issue, as to where the UI needs to be added (we are guessing it to be Churn forecast admin tool), input fields of the UI, etc. We have now identified the files that need code changes. Need more clarity on the business requirements.<BR/>o    <BR/>I was under the impression the problem was in how MRR values are being displayed in the Admin Tool  Can you give me some additional details as to your assessment of the problem and how to resolve same ?<BR/>This issue was actually for providing exceptions to certain categories from a "30-day window period" that needs to be provided to the clients before taking their devices offline. Currently they are being done by harcoding these categories in the code, rather they want a UI from where they can edit the categories that can be exempted from the 30-day grace period.<BR/>Okay, I was thinking about LAM-907, thanks for the correction.<BR/><BR/>So it seems you need clarification as to the specific Categories they want ?  If this is the case then I would say code some dummy categories while I work on the requirements.<BR/>            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>19700101T052534Z</created><updated>19700101T052534Z</updated><tag>rackspace</tag></note></en-export>
