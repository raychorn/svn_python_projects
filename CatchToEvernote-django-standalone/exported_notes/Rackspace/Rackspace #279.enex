So the main problem about this issue is that the values from the "Summary" page and that of the "details" page are not in sync. We were able to reproduce this scenario by first selecting a reason ( say migration category) for churn forecast giving its MRR as $75 saving this forecast and then again editing the same "Churnforecast" by choosing the category as "downgrade" ( in latter case the MRR by default becomes "0" in the details page whereas the summary page MRR still remains as $75). We will keep you posted on this<BR/><BR/>Then it seems you may be on track with learning how to fix this issue.  Find-out why the following corrects the issue: (learning this might lead to a fix)<BR/><BR/>saving this forecast and then again editing the same "Churnforecast" by choosing the category as "downgrade"<BR/>            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>19700101T052534Z</created><updated>19700101T052534Z</updated><tag>rackspace</tag></note></en-export>
