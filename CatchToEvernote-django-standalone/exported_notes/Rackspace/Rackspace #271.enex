As once the renewal order is triggered, the code control is transferred to "MyRack" portal and we will not be able to update the ticket with error right after the "Purchase order" ( as the purchase order gets printed from "MyRack" team and not by us).<BR/><BR/>Refrence links:<BR/><BR/>Jira link : http://jira.core.rackspace.com/browse/LAM-868 Refrence Ticket link: 120427-09120 (Can be viewed from CORE)<BR/><BR/>Thanks<BR/><BR/>==============================================================<BR/><BR/>LAM-868 Meeting on 08-07-2012 8a Read Window 2320<BR/><BR/>Change the order to print the P.O. before the Cert Update.  Aurora to verify the fix.  JIRA Issue will be created for this.  After the 08-21 Update... next update is the 08-28 Tuesday.  Core update is the 24th.  Jim Albert to be included.  Print the P.O. before the update cert call in MyRack Portal.  Portal does not always know the state of the devices; call to get the device status takes 90 secs...            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>20120807T013731Z</created><updated>19700101T052528Z</updated></note></en-export>
