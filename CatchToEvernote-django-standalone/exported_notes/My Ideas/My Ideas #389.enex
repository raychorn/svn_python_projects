Look no further, i will list them here. You can find you basic scripts at http://www.eljercode.com/ <BR/>Look those over. They are great. Especially TimeLive Local. If you use Firefox you will need the Greasemonkey extension. If you use Chrome you may need the Tampermonkey extension to make them work. Open Parser is another great script. It will let you track and find players anywhere and anytime. <BR/><BR/>-Scripts <BR/>http://www.eljercode.com/ <BR/><BR/>-Open Parser <BR/>http://www.openparser.com/ <BR/><BR/>-Greasemonkey <BR/>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ <BR/><BR/>-Tampermonkey <BR/>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=fr <BR/><BR/>(If you are having trouble with Chrome getting them to work. Chrome blocked some stuff along time ago. You can get around it with Tampermokey, but if you want to read about others and how they dealt with it, you can read it here..... http://forum.playstarfleet.com/index.php?topic=17679.0 ) <BR/><BR/>These tools are extremely important. USE THEM! If you are a NPC attacker only, Open Parser isn't as important, but Battlement and BattleCalc are. <BR/><BR/>-BattleMentat is a great Combat Calculator. The best in my opinion. It will tell you almost anything you want to know about the attack. A downside is that if you play on your phone it doesn't seem to want to work if you have a Iphone. Works better with Android i think. <BR/>http://www.battlementat.com/#universe=stardrift <BR/><BR/>-Battlecalc is a older Combat Calculator but is still useful. It works ok, but seems to get a little off with huge fleets and when Zeus or Titan ships are involved. But it does work. The big plus is it works on phones well. <BR/>http://www.battlecalc.com/ <BR/><BR/>-OpenParser will help you find and track enemies. An amazing tool if you know how to use it. <BR/>http://sde.openparser.com/ <BR/><BR/>(Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Contact me anytime and i will get back with you as soon as i can. And remember, NO FRS NO FLEET!!!) <BR/><BR/>#gameplay            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>19700101T053006Z</created><updated>19700101T053006Z</updated><tag>universe</tag><tag>gameplay</tag></note></en-export>
