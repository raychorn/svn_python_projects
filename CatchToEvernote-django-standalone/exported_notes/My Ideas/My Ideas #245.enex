Net-net, there's not an easy way to quit the app to reload an updated XML file. (Can we enable the exit button in the menu?)<BR/><BR/>(1) The App exits RAM when the user hits the Home or Back buttons - I have checked this myself to make sure this is happening however I can enable the Exit button via funded development time. 1 hr (Development and testing)<BR/><BR/>When showing an image, the title bar says "Cisco Amazon Kindle Fire Demo v0.8.0 :: Viewing "tab1" 1 of 8" - can this be removed so we only see the image we are displaying.<BR/><BR/>(2) I can check to see if this can be done however it will require 1 hour of funded development time.<BR/><BR/><BR/>I've loaded two images (the two screen shots I sent you the other day) to test the app - although I can see the first one, no amount of clicking, advances me to the next image. (My XML file may be off - still checking on that).<BR/><BR/>(3)  XML issues will continue to be a problem however Cisco has the option of funding more development time if they wish - I recommend they request a Desktop-based Builder App which would require an additional 100 hours of development.<BR/><BR/><BR/>(4) I could whip-up some Builder functions for the Kindle for 150 hours of development time. (I have actually done this work already however I had to spend 150 hours to make this work).<BR/><BR/><BR/>When the Nav bar is shown, clicking on a navigation button hides the nav bar - the nav bar should explicitly remain until it's toggled off.<BR/><BR/>(5) I could make this an option via the XML file for 2-3 hours of funded development time.<BR/><BR/>Finally, could you also please provide some documentation on the XML syntax - what each tag does, and perhaps a sample ("hello, world") XML file or two.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>(6) I have passed several sample files to Dave however he really needs a Builder App either for the Desktop (Windows or Mac) or Android (see my estimates above for the development time required).<BR/><BR/>            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>19700101T052201Z</created><updated>19700101T052201Z</updated><tag>Cisco_Amazon_Kindle_Fire_Demo</tag></note></en-export>
