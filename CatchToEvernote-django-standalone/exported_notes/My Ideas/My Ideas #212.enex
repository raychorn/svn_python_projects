You won't get any useful information from Google in this regard. In fact, almost nobody else has solved this problem in the exact specific manner that I have let alone even be aware of it other than to replace trig functions with non-trig analogs... I developed a useful working algorithm right off the top of my head... and it works ! When I say "Hyper-Fast" I mean really fast as-in "man, that was fast...". But then when you have 10+ terabytes of data to sift through quickly and you want to splash some data onto a Map using GPS Coordinates you need a Hyper-Fast method for determining exactly which 30 foot by 40 foot area each data element is associated with; this also works with larger areas, for instance - the size of the area is not important and does not have any impact on the performance of my method. (Please don't ask for a Tutorial or detailed explanation of my technique... spend some time learning what Haversines are and how to locate data elements with a region on a map - sounds simple until you have to sift through millions or billions of rows of data...)<BR/><BR/>Additionally, I have created a Real-Time Method for performing Data Aggregations for BigData. The amount of data is NOT important for this method for any case other than the initial scan to collect the initial Data Aggregation Set. This is a big deal for Analytics, obviously.<BR/><BR/>Let's not gloss-over the value in being able to make BigData handle data FAST !!!  <BR/><BR/>Also let's not gloss-over my technical skills... very few software design houses can push complete software products from start to finish in less than 6 months however I was able to do this for AmazingFacts.Org (1 Product on 2 Platforms, Windows and Mac, in 2 Languages, Spanish and English, in less than 4 months based on a completely functional prototype that came together during the initial 30 hours... Obviously I like to reward those who can engage me based on a minimal process rather than those who require proof based on how I might talk about what I do...)<BR/><BR/>Let's talk about Mobile Development for Android and iOS. Android is the winner and Apple is playing catch-up. My idea of Mobile Development is a reusable Framework for Android and iOS that allows me to deploy the same core code to Android of iOS with a matching App for the Desktop and I mean ALL Desktops (Windows + Mac + Linux) using the same core code with Native Look and Feel for every deployment and Native code for Android and iOS. I go one step further by leveraging the Cloud for Distributed Processing and Distributed Data. This allows my customers to go Mobile when they want to and Desktop when they want to all using the same data with seamless transition from Mobile to Desktop and back.<BR/><BR/>Let's talk about Cloud Computing... I like to leverage the Google App Engine (GAE) because I can do so at virtually NO COST by blending-in a number of Cloud-based Service Providers including but not limited to Amazon EC2 (great for low-cost VM-based distributed-data distributed-computing needs) and others. In more than 2+ years I have never had to pay for my use of GAE. I also like to use a standard Cloud Processing Framework I can deploy everywhere using the same core code with only minor modifications based on the specific platform of choice whether that be GAE or Amazon EC2.<BR/><BR/>Let's talk Virtualization... I like to deploy robust Linux-based servers and systems that leverage Virtualization to the extent possible. The proper use of Virtualization can make deployments both easier and more robust. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) forms the base of all my preferred systems mixed with XenServer and XenCenter or the like because as we all know one server can do many things and Virtualization makes big servers run like a bunch of smaller servers all working together. Virtualization also makes all my own deployments more robust as flexible by empowering me to cruise ahead to the next solution and the next set of very happy customers.<BR/><BR/>Greater San Francisco Bay Area, between and including San Jose and Sacramento only !<BR/><BR/>Bay Area:  $80/hr c2c/1099 or $135k+.<BR/>CA other than Bay Area:  $95/hr c2c/1099<BR/>Remote Telecommute:  $55/hr c2c/1099<BR/><BR/>Open to remote telecommute for assignments outside my preferred geographic area.<BR/><BR/>Python/Django/Android/jQuery/JavaScript/Flex/AS3/Ruby/RoR/Rails/PHP/HTML/CSS/SalesForce/Visual Force/Apex/Google App Engine/Amazon EC2/Virtualization (That's right, all of them...)<BR/><BR/>SalesForce.Com Evangelist since 2003.<BR/><BR/>Python Evangelist since 2004.<BR/><BR/>ColdFusion Evangelist 1999-2006.<BR/><BR/>Flash/Flex RIA Evangelist since 1999.<BR/><BR/>Google App Engine Evangelist since April 2008.<BR/><BR/>Amazon AWS/EC2/S3, et.al.
