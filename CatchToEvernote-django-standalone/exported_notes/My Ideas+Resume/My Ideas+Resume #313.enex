Those who don't have the experience will want to do this video playback thing using old-school techniques and they will always spend 10x more time banging their heads against a brick-wall until they are done - eventually. Those who know what they are doing will just do it and get on to the next thing using far less effort than the rest.<BR/><BR/>I was paid $100/hr c2c for the Cisco Systems Project plus another $20k bonus upon completion.<BR/><BR/>100% REMOTE OFFSITE for only $55/hr c2c or an equivalent salary.<BR/><BR/>Keep in mind, I am Agile ( http://wp.me/Pdk8l-h1 ) and Certified.<BR/><BR/>I am most available after 3p PDT M-F via 415-314-5967 (cell); my availability increases the greater the distance from 3p PDT.<BR/><BR/>#resume            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>20121003T091659Z</created><updated>19700101T052633Z</updated><tag>resume</tag></note></en-export>
