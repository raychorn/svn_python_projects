BTW Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+IIS7 works just as easily for Windows as Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx works for Linux but then I can also do Python+Django+Tornado+wsgi+nginx for Windows too.   <BR/><BR/> I have also been doing native Django in the Google App Engine; native Django is different than the typical Django Google chose to include with the Google App Engine - by native I mean just that, the same Django App you might run outside the Google App Engine also works inside the Google App Engine - NATIVE !!!<BR/><BR/>Just wanted to level-set your expectations before we talk.<BR/><BR/>A small software engineering code sample featuring the Python language:  (I can do this with any language show in my Resume...)<BR/><BR/>http://python2.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/animal-kingdom-interview-sample/<BR/><BR/>I was able to very quickly produce this code during the same time the Interviewer had difficulties making his code work.<BR/><BR/>Python Bug Fixer since 2008 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/~mrpython94596)<BR/><BR/>Just a small sample of what I can do.<BR/><BR/>100% REMOTE OFFSITE for only $55/hr c2c or an equivalent salary.<BR/><BR/>I can do this same thing with Java, JavaScript, AS3, ColdFusion, Scala, Ruby, Ant or any other language found in my Resume; just sharing what I can do given my level of professional maturity in the Agile Software Development Process.<BR/><BR/>Keep in mind, I am Agile ( http://wp.me/Pdk8l-h1 ) and Certified.<BR/><BR/>I am most available after 3p PDT M-F via 415-314-5967 (cell); my availability increases the greater the distance from 3p PDT.<BR/>            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>20121002T034257Z</created><updated>19700101T052630Z</updated></note></en-export>
