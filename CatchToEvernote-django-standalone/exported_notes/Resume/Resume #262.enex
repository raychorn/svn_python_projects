BigFix was later bought my IBM and the BigFix products are being converted into IBM Product Offerings.<BR/>Magma Design Automation - hired as a contractor and won my perm employee role after 6 long months as a contractor; my mother was busy dying however I remained on the job working to keep my job through every single wave of lay-offs right until there were exactly 2 employees left in my department and then I was laid-off - I also took several pay-cuts to keep my job during this period.  The fact that I was willing to take several cuts in my salary and I had to listen to my siblings tell me about my mother's final days in the hospital rather than go and see her myself proves I am more than loyal to those who have chosen to employ me and while I may not ever get another opportunity to have to visit my mother I did remain employed for as long as possible in this and every other situation in which I have ever been employed.<BR/>Smith Micro - hired as a contractor, created several unique problem solutions and was asked to go perm however I had to wait until the cost to be taken perm was reduced and during this time Smith Micro announced a major lay-off on or about the end of Oct 2011 - I kept my contracting job right up until 20% of all perm employees were laid-off.<BR/>I have proven my value as a Senior Software Engineer.<BR/><BR/>I am not the one who has chosen to cut any of my employment engagements short.<BR/>            </en-note></en-note>]]></content><created>19700101T052437Z</created><updated>19700101T052437Z</updated></note></en-export>
