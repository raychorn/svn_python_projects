Also created a Real-time Data Processing Pattern that works for all applications and uses including those that require the use of slower database platforms such as but not limited to HADOOP.  My Hyper-Fast Geo-tagging Algorithm does not use proximity detection as others in the industry tend to use in the form of the Haversines function.<BR/><BR/>** AmazingFacts.Org - Interactive Multimedia Presentation Player for Windows and Mac - 1 Product on 2 Platforms in 3-4 months as an individual contributor (http://youtu.be/EmFnROmext4).<BR/><BR/>** Stealth Startup, via Vyper Logix Corp, working to build their Alpha Site capable of matching Shippers with Cargo Carriers for future equity. Successfully changed technology expectations away from PHP in favor of Python/Django.   Just to wet your appetite for my skills...  I recently built a Python/Django/nginx/tornado/wsgi site for one of the startups I am working to support for future equity and it all runs in Ubuntu 12.04 hosted with Amazon/EC2 and 2 other providers at the same time; I had no problems deploying this site to all 3 providers. (See also: http://cargochief.vyperlogix.com <--- I am the Lead Developer who is also handling 100% of the I.T. Infrastructure as well as leading the development effort.)<BR/><BR/>** Reverse Engineered the Google Search Engine - now I can show you using any Whiteboard how you too can craft your own Google Search Engine by leveraging the Real-time Data Processing Pattern.<BR/><BR/>** Sample Google AppEngine Projects:<BR/><BR/>www.VyperLogix.Com --> http://www.vyperlogix.com and www.CargoChief.Com --> http://www.cargochief.com<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex Adobe Flash performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques others seem unable to use when they should.<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to resolve complex HADOOP performance problems by using simple over-looked techniques I have been using for many years for my own projects.<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to use the same files and the same data when deploying applications and services for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS even when these operating systems appear to be very different for most people - all these operating systems work exactly the same for me and the code I routinely write.  Write the code once and deploy everywhere, this is what I bring to the table.<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to optimize the handling of billions or trillions of GPS Coordinates for the purpose of handling real-time updates for Analytics Systems that feature Map-based displays of aggregations of data based on all those GPS Coordinates.<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to reverse-engineer the Google Search Engine, without ever having to see their code, just by observation and conjecture.  Ask me to tell you all about this once you have hired me.<BR/><BR/>Experience gives me the ability to deploy H.264 Streaming Video Apps for Android with much less effort than those who seek to use more traditional development methods.<BR/><BR/>I have current start-up experience and have worked for several start-ups during my career.<BR/><BR/>Disclaimer: I need to know the name of the end-client or hiring company before my Resume can be sent to them for their review.
