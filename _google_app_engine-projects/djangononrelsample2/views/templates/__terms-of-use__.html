					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<p><strong>2.1 {{ company }} Services with a Managed Service Level.</strong> If you purchase {{ company }} Cloud 	Servers with a Managed Service Level, then {{ company }} live support will be available to you 24 	hours per day, 7 days a week, year round. You may request support by opening a support ticket, 	or a one-on-one chat, via your {{ company }} Control Panel or by calling your {{ company }} Services with a Managed Service Level account team.</p>

					<ul class="tos-subterms">
					<li><strong>Availability Monitoring.</strong> {{ company }} will monitor up to 2 TCP ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, 		POP3, etc.) per server for service availability.

You may also configure monitoring for one URL&rsquo;s content. Port and 		URL content checks are done every five (5) minutes.</li>
					<li><strong>Fault Monitoring.</strong> {{ company }} monitors status events on servers and network devices 		including network availability, and backup success/failure.</li>
					<li><strong>Notification of Monitoring Alerts.</strong> We will notify you of monitoring alerts.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="YourObligations" class="cloud">3. YOUR OBLIGATIONS.</h4>
					<p>You agree to do each of the following: (i) comply with applicable  law and the {{ company }} Acceptable Use Policy (ii) pay when due the  fees for the Services, (iii) use reasonable security precautions in  light of your use of the Services, including encrypting any PII transmitted to or from, or stored on, the {{ company }} Services you use (iv) cooperate with {{ company }}'s  reasonable investigation of outages, security problems, and any  suspected breach of the Agreement, (v) keep your billing contact and  other account information up to date; and (vi) immediately notify  {{ company }} of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of  security. In the event of a dispute between us regarding the  interpretation of applicable law or the AUP, {{ company }}'s reasonable  determination shall control.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="AccessToTheServices" class="cloud">4. ACCESS TO THE SERVICES.</h4>
					<p>You may access the Services via the online control panel, or via a  {{ company }}-provided Application Programming Interface or API. {{ company }}  may modify its control panel or APIs at any time, or may transition to  new API's. Your use of any API you download from the {{ company }} website  is governed by the license terms included with the code in the file  named "COPYING" or "LICENSE" or like caption.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="ServiceLevelAgreement" class="cloud">5. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT.</h4>
					<p>The Service Level Agreement(s) listed below are part of this Agreement for those Services you are buying:</p>
					<ul class="standard">
					</ul>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="Term" class="cloud">6. TERM.</h4>
					<p>The initial term for each Order begins on the date we make the  Services available for your use and continues for the period stated in  the Order. If no period is stated in the Order, then the initial term  shall be one month. Upon expiration of the initial term, the Order will  automatically renew for successive renewal terms of one month each,  unless and until one of us gives the other a written notice of  non-renewal prior to the expiration of the initial term, or then-current  renewal term, as applicable. You must follow {{ company }}'s non-renewal  process accessible from your control panel to give an effective notice  of non-renewal.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="Fees" class="cloud">7. FEES.</h4>
					<p>{{ company }} will charge you the fees stated in your Order.  If you  have made a minimum commitment in your Order, and your actual usage does  not meet or exceed the minimum commitment, {{ company }} will charge you  the difference between your minimum commitment and your actual usage.  Unless you have made other arrangements, {{ company }} will charge your  credit card without invoice as follows: (i) for recurring fees, in  advance, on or around the first day of each billing cycle, and (ii) for  non-recurring fees (such as fees for initial set-up, overages, compute  cycle fees, and domain name registration) on or around the date  incurred, or on or around the first day of the billing cycle that  follows the date incurred, at {{ company }}'s option; provided that  {{ company }} may wait to charge your credit card until the total aggregate  fees due are at least $50. Unless otherwise agreed in the Order, your  billing cycle will be monthly, beginning on the date that {{ company }}  first makes the Services available to you. If you are using {{ company }}'s  billing services, as described in Section 31 (Billing Services) below,  {{ company }} may at its option, either include the fees, charge backs, and  other items described in Section 31 with your recurring or non-recurring  fees, as applicable, or deduct them from your remittances. {{ company }}  may suspend all services (including services provided pursuant to any  unrelated Order or other agreement we may have with you) if our charges  to your credit card are rejected for any reason. {{ company }} may charge  interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate  if it is less than 1.5%). If any amount is overdue by more than thirty  (30) days, and {{ company }} brings a legal action to collect, or engages a  collection agency, you must also pay {{ company }}'s reasonable costs of  collection, including attorney fees and court costs.  All fees are  stated and will be charged in US Dollars. Any "credit" that we may owe  you, such as a credit for failure to meet a service level guaranty, will  be applied to fees due from you for services, and will not be paid to  you as a refund. Charges that are not disputed within sixty (60) days of  the date charged are conclusively deemed accurate. You must provide  {{ company }} with accurate factual information to help {{ company }} determine  if any tax is due with respect to the provision of the Services, and if  {{ company }} is required by law to collect taxes on the provision of the  Services, you must pay {{ company }} the amount of the tax that is due or  provide satisfactory evidence of your exemption from the tax.  You  authorize {{ company }} to obtain a credit report at any time during the  term of the Agreement. Any credit that we may owe you, such as a credit  for a SLA remedy, will be applied to unpaid fees for services or  refunded to you, at our option.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="FeeIncreases" class="cloud">8. FEE INCREASES.</h4>
					<p>If you are under a month-to-month contract, then we may increase  fees at any time on forty-five (45) days advance written notice. If the  initial term of your Agreement is longer than one month, then we may  increase your fees effective as of the first day of the renewal term  that first begins forty-five days from the day of our written notice of a  fee increase. In addition, if during the initial term or any renewal  term there is an increase in the Producer Price Index over the Producer  Price Index reported for the month in which you signed your Order, we  may increase your fees by the same percentage as the increase in the  Producer Price Index; provided that we may not increase your fees  pursuant to this sentence more often than once per twelve months, and we  must give you at least thirty days advance written notice of the  increase. The "Producer Price Index" means the Producer Price Index for  Finished Goods, WPUSOP3000, not seasonally adjusted, and first published  as "preliminary" data by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics  in its PPI Detailed Report or successor publication. For historical  information on the Producer Price Index, you may visit the Bureau of  Labor Statistics website. (Example: if the Producer Price Index for the  month in which you sign the Order is 186, and then increases in a  subsequent month during the term of the Order to 195, we may increase  your fees by up to 4.8%).</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="Suspension" class="cloud">9. SUSPENSION.</h4>
					<p>We may suspend your Services without liability if: (i) we reasonably  believe that the Services are being used (or have been or will be used)  in violation of the Agreement, (ii) we discover that you are, or are  affiliated in any manner with, a person who has used similar services  abusively in the past; (iii) you don't cooperate with our reasonable  investigation of any suspected violation of the Agreement; (iv) we  reasonably believe that your Services have been accessed or manipulated  by a third party without your consent, (v) we reasonably believe that  suspension of the Services is necessary to protect our network or our  other customers, (vi) a payment for the Services is overdue, or (vii)  suspension is required by law. We will give you reasonable advance  notice of a suspension under this paragraph and a chance to cure the  grounds on which the suspension are based, unless we determine, in our  reasonable commercial judgment, that a suspension on shorter or  contemporaneous notice is necessary to protect {{ company }} or its other  customers from imminent and significant operational or security risk. If  the suspension was based on your breach of your obligations under the  Agreement, then we may continue to charge you the fees for the Services  during the suspension, and may charge you a reasonable reinstatement fee  (not to exceed $150) upon reinstatement of the Services.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="TerminationForConvenience" class="cloud">10. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE; EARLY TERMINATION FEE.</h4>
					<p>You may terminate the Agreement for convenience at any time on  thirty days advance written notice. If you terminate the Agreement for  convenience, in addition to other amounts you may owe, you must pay an  early termination fee equal to any minimum monthly financial commitment  you have made for the remaining portion of the then-current term.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="TerminationForBreach" class="cloud">11. TERMINATION FOR BREACH.</h4>
					<p>We may terminate the Agreement for breach on written notice if: (i)  we discover that the information you provided to us about yourself or  your proposed use of the Services was materially inaccurate or  incomplete, (ii) if you are an individual, you were not at least 18  years old or otherwise did not have the legal capacity to enter into the  Agreement at the time you submitted the Order for Services, or if you  are an entity or fiduciary, the individual submitting the Order for  Services did not have the legal right or authority to enter into the  Agreement on behalf of the person represented to be the customer, (iii)  your payment of any invoiced amount is overdue, and you do not pay the  overdue amount within three (3) days of our written notice, (iv) a  credit report indicates you no longer meet our reasonable credit  criteria, provided that if we terminate on these grounds, we must give  you a reasonable opportunity to migrate your environment out of  {{ company }} in an orderly fashion, (v) you use your Service in violation  of the AUP and fail to remedy the violation within ten (10) days of our  written notice, (vi) you violate the AUP more than once, even if you  cure each violation, or (vii) you fail to comply with any other  provision of the Agreement and do not remedy the failure within thirty  (30) days of our notice to you describing the failure.</p>
					<p>You may terminate the Agreement for breach on written notice if: (i)  we materially fail to provide the Services as agreed and do not remedy  that failure within five (5) days of your written notice describing the  failure, or (ii) we materially fail to meet any other obligation stated  in the Agreement and do not remedy that failure within thirty (30) days  of your written notice describing the failure.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="AccessToData" class="cloud">12. ACCESS TO DATA.</h4>
					<p><strong>12.1</strong> You will not have access to your data stored on the {% autoescape off %}{{ sitename }}{% endautoescape %} system during a suspension or following termination.</p>
					<p><strong>12.2</strong> We backup the {{ company }} systems on a periodic  basis so that we are able to more quickly restore the systems in the  event of a failure. These backups are made on a snap-shot basis and,  therefore, capture only the information that exists on the system at the  time of the backup. In addition, we may destroy all but the most recent  backup. These backups may not be available to you or, if available, may  not be useful to you outside of the {{ company }} systems.</p>
					<p><strong>12.3</strong> Although the {{ company }} services may be used as a  backup service, you agree that you will maintain at least one additional  current copy of your programs and data stored on the {{ company }}  systems somewhere other than on the {{ company }} systems .</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="UnauthorizedAccess" class="cloud">13. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR DATA OR USE OF THE SERVICES.</h4>
					<p>{{ company }} is not responsible to you for unauthorized access to your  data or the unauthorized use of the Services unless the unauthorized  access or use results from {{ company }}'s failure to meet its security  obligations stated in the Agreement. You are responsible for the use of  the Services by any employee of yours, any person to whom you have given  access to the Services, and any person who gains access to your data or  the Services as a result of your failure to use reasonable security  precautions, even if such use was not authorized by you.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="Disclaimers" class="cloud">14. DISCLAIMERS.</h4>
					<p><strong>We do not promise that the Services will be uninterrupted,  error-free, or completely secure. You acknowledge that there are risks  inherent in Internet connectivity that could result in the loss of your  privacy, Confidential Information, and property. {{ company }} has no  obligation to provide security other than as stated in this Agreement.  We disclaim any and all warranties not expressly stated in the  Agreement, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness  for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. You are solely  responsible for the suitability of the service chosen. If you have not  made the minimum financial commitment for support and SLA coverage, the  Services are provided AS IS. Any voluntary services we may perform for  you at your request and without any additional charge are provided AS  IS. </strong></p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="ExportMatters" class="cloud">15. EXPORT MATTERS.</h4>
					<p>You represent and warrant that you are not on the United States  Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controls list of  Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons and are not otherwise a  person to whom {{ company }} is legally prohibited to provide the Services.  You may not use the Services for the development, design, manufacture,  production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear, chemical or biological  weapons, weapons of mass destruction, or missiles, in a country listed  in Country Groups D: 4 and D: 3, as set forth in Supplement No. 1 to the  Part 740 of the United States Export Administration Regulations, nor  may you provide administrative access to the Service to any person  (including any natural person or government or private entity ) that is  located in or is a national of Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan, North Korea or  Syria or any country that is embargoed or highly restricted under United  States export regulations.</p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="ConfidentialInformation" class="cloud">16. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</h4>
					<p>Each of us agrees not to use the other's Confidential Information  except in connection with the performance or use of the Services, as  applicable, the exercise of our respective legal rights under the  Agreement, or as may be required by law. Each of us agrees not to  disclose the other's Confidential Information to any third person except  as follows:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman; list-style-position: inside;">

					</ul>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="LimitationonDamages" class="cloud">17. LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.</h4>
					<p>Our obligations to you are defined by this Agreement. We are not  liable to you for failing to provide the Services unless the failure  results from a breach of this Agreement, or results from our gross  negligence or willful misconduct. The dollar credits stated in the  Service Level Agreement are your <strong>sole and exclusive</strong> remedy for unavailability of the Services.</p>
					<p><strong>Neither of us (nor any of our employees, agents, affiliates or  suppliers) is liable to the other for any lost profits or any other  indirect, special, incidental or consequential loss or damages of any  kind, or for any loss that could have been avoided by the damaged  party's use of reasonable diligence, even if the party responsible for  the damages has been advised or should be aware of the possibility of  such damages. In no event shall either of us be liable to the other for  any punitive damages.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, except  for liability based on willful misconduct or fraudulent  misrepresentation, and liability for death or personal injury resulting  from {{ company }}'s negligence, the maximum aggregate monetary liability of  {{ company }} and any of its employees, agents, suppliers, or affiliates in  connection with the Services, the Agreement, and any act or omission  related to the Services or Agreement, under any theory of law (including  breach of contract, tort, strict liability, violation of law, and  infringement) shall not exceed the greater of (i) the amount of fees you  paid for the Services for the six months prior to the occurrence of the  event giving rise to the claim, or (ii) Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).</strong></p>
					<p><br /><br /></p>
					<h4 id="Indemnification" class="cloud">18. INDEMNIFICATION.</h4>
					<p>If we, our affiliates, or any of our or their respective employees, agents, or suppliers (the "<strong>{{ company }} Indemnitees</strong>")  are faced with a legal claim by a third party arising out of your  actual or alleged gross negligence, willful misconduct, violation of  law, failure to meet the security obligations required by the Agreement,  violation of the AUP, or violation of Section 15 (Export Matters) of  these Terms and Conditions, then you will pay the cost of defending the  claim (including reasonable attorney fees) and any damages award, fine,  or other amount that is imposed on the {{ company }} Indemnitees as a result  of the claim. Your obligations under this subsection include claims  arising out of the acts or omissions of your employees, any other person  to whom you have given access to the Services, and any person who gains  access to the Services as a result of your failure to use reasonable  security precautions, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were  not authorized by you. If you resell the Services, the grounds for  indemnification stated above also include any claim brought by your  customers or end users arising out of your resale of the Services. We  will choose legal counsel to defend the claim, provided that these  decisions must be reasonable and must be promptly communicated to you.  You must comply with our reasonable requests for assistance and  cooperation in the defense of the claim. We may not settle the claim  without your consent, although such consent may not be unreasonably  withheld. You must pay expenses due under this Section as we incur them.</p>

					<h4 id="MicrosoftSoftware" class="cloud">19. MICROSOFT SOFTWARE &amp; LICENSE MOBILITY.</h4>

If you resell any part of the Services that includes  Microsoft software, then you must include these Microsoft terms  described in Section 19 (Microsoft Software) above in a written  agreement with your customers as well as the content of Section 23 (No  High Risk Use). Unless otherwise agreed, {{ company }} will provide support  only to you, not to any other person you authorize to use the Services.

					<h4 id="GoverningLawLawsuits" class="cloud">28. GOVERNING LAW, LAWSUITS</h4>
					<p>The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, exclusive of any Texas choice of law principle that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction, and the laws of the United States of America, as applicable. The Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Each of us agrees that any dispute or claim, including without limitation, statutory, contract or tort claims, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the alleged breach of this Agreement, shall, upon timely written request of either of us, be submitted to binding arbitration.&nbsp; The party asserting the claim may elect to have the arbitration be in-person, telephonic or decided based on written submissions.

We agree that we will not seek reimbursement of our fees and expenses if the arbitrator rules in our favor. You and we waive any right to a trial by jury, so that disputes will be resolved through arbitration. No claim subject to this provision may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may you assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant. Each of us agrees that we will not bring a claim under the Agreement more than two years after the time that the claim accrued.

					<h4 id="SomeAgreementMechanics" class="cloud">29. SOME AGREEMENT MECHANICS</h4>
					<p>These Terms of Service may have been incorporated in your Order by  reference to page on the {{ company }} website. Although we may from time to  time revise the Terms of Service posted on that page, those revisions  will not be effective as to an Order that we accepted prior to the date  we posted the revision, and your Order will continue to be governed by  the Terms of Service posted on the effective date of the Order. However,  any amended Terms of Service will become effective on the first day of  the renewal period that follows the date that the new Terms of Service  were posted by at least thirty days. In addition, if over time you sign  multiple Orders for a single account, then the Terms of Service  incorporated in the latest Order posted on the effective date of the  latest Order will govern the entire account. {{ company }} may accept or  reject any Order you submit in its sole discretion. {{ company }}'s  provisioning of the Services described in an Order shall be {{ company }}'s  acceptance of the Order.</p>
					<p>An Order may be amended by a formal written agreement signed by both  parties, or by an exchange of correspondence, including electronic  mail, that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for  each of us. Any such correspondence that adds or modifies Services in  connection with an account established by an Order shall be deemed to be  an amendment to that Order, notwithstanding the fact that the  correspondence does not expressly refer to the Order.</p>
					<p>Other than as stated herein, the Agreement may be modified only by a formal document signed by both parties.</p>
					<p>If there is a conflict between the terms of any of the documents  that comprise the Agreement, the documents will govern in the following  order: Order, Terms of Service, and the Acceptable Use Policy. If any  part of the Agreement is found unenforceable by a court or other  tribunal, the rest of the Agreement will nonetheless continue in effect,  and we agree that the tribunal may reform the unenforceable part if it  is possible to do so consistent with the material economic incentives of  the parties resulting in this Agreement. Each of us may enforce each of  our respective rights under the Agreement even if we have waived the  right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past. Our  relationship is that of independent contractors and not business  partners. Neither of us is the agent for the other, and neither of us  has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party. The  captions in the Agreement are for convenience only and are not part of  the Agreement. The use of the word "including" in the Agreement shall be  read to mean "including without limitation." Sections 1, 7, 10, 16, 17,  18, 22, 24, 28, 29, 33 and all other provisions that by their nature  are intended to survive expiration or termination of the Agreement shall  survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p>
					<p>If you have made any change to the Agreement documents that you did  not bring to our attention in a way that is reasonably calculated to put  us on notice of the change, the change shall not become part of the  Agreement.</p>
					<p>The Agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts, which, taken  together, will be considered one original. Facsimile signatures,  signatures on an electronic image (such as .pdf or .jpg format), and  electronic signatures shall be deemed to be original signatures.</p>

Email that is quarantined by the  filtering system is excluded from the Service Level Guaranty above.  {{ company }} will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver your email  messages. Third party filtering services may from time to time prevent  successful delivery of your messages. <strong>You acknowledge that the  technological limitations of the filtering service will likely result in  the capture of some legitimate email and the failure to capture some  unwanted email, including email infected with viruses. You hereby  release {{ company }} and its employees, agents, affiliates, and third party  suppliers from any liability for damages arising from the failure of  {{ company }}'s filtering services to capture unwanted email or from the  capture of legitimate email, or from a failure of your email to reach  its intended recipient as a result of a filtering service used by the  recipient or the recipient's email service provider.</strong></p>
