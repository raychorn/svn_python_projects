"""RESTful Controller

We want our RESTful controllers to simply throw up their hands if they get
an unhandled HTTP verb.  This is better for rich clients and server load
than throwing back lots of useless HTML.

These inherited methods should be overridden if there's a chance a human
browser is involved.

TODO: Return more information HTTP status codes that won't autotrip browser login forms.
For example, return status 405 (Method not allowed) with an Allow header containing the
list of valid methods.

    3) tuple (string, func, previous strings...) -> Same as above but the parameters to func are current property values in our hash
