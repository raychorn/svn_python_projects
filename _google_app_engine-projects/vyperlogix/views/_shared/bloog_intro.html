    <h2>Welcome to Bloog</h2>
    <div class="entry">
    <p>This is the default root page for Bloog, a simple RESTful blog/homepage on Google AppEngine, and
        shows what it looks like out of the box with no posts or pages.  You can see 
        <a href="http://billkatz-test.appspot.com">a Bloog with data here</a>.</p>
    <p>Bloog is open sourced under the MIT License.
       Source code can be found on the <a href="http://github.com/DocSavage/bloog">GitHub Bloog repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Bloog was created to experiment with blog ideas on Google AppEngine while allowing migration from a legacy blog. 
        These goals shape the feature set, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A resource-oriented architecture, as described in the great book
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596529260/writertopia-20">RESTful Web Services</a></li>
        <li>A <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> converter/uploader that queries a local MySQL database 
            and uploads the data to a Bloog through REST calls.</li>
        <li>A datastore deletion utility that can clear out your entities in your Bloog's datastore.</li>
        <li>Arbitrary URL aliases, which can be created by the drupal uploader, that provide redirection from legacy urls.
            There's also a programmatic aliasing function that can take a regex like <code>'node/(.*)'</code> and map it to legacy IDs
            stored with the blog entries.  (http://foo.com/node/4 is a typical Drupal url.)</li>
        <li>Dynamic per-article sidebars. (in progress)</li>
        <li>A <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">Yahoo UI</a> 
            AJAX front-end for posting and managing entries in a RESTful way. (in progress)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From an AppEngine developer's perspective, you may find the source code interesting to examine due to things like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RESTful design using webapp.</li>
        <li>Convention-over-configuration in organizing controller and view files.</li>
        <li>Authorization using python decorators and built-in Google authentication.</li>
        <li>Caching using global variables.</li>
        <li>Some timing facility to test different datastore models.</li>
        <li>Serialization of a python object into a datastore blob.</li>
        <li>An example of full-text searching using the slightly documented appengine.ext.search module.
            (This works but was commented out due to a weird (Google?) bug when uploading large posts.  Perhaps a timeout?
             It works fine for smaller posts on Google hosts and all posts locally.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your login has administrative permission for this Bloog, you can add articles after 
        <a href="{{ login_url }}">login</a>.</p>
