About RayCHorn.Com

RayCHorn.Com shows what I can do with Flex, Flash, jQuery, JavaScript and Python all running on the Google App Engine.  This site may not look like much but it uses techniques most Fortune 500 companies would want to know how to do if only they knew there was any value in doing it.  Just try right-clicking on the Flash animation sitting on the header for this site - it doesn't act like a normal typical Flash thing because it doesn't tell you about the Flash Player and doesn't show a context menu - again this is something most Flex/Flash/AS3 developers may not know about, I once worked with a guy who said he had more experience than myself and he did not know how to manipulate the right-click menu at-all.  Then consider the 3 distinct layers - again something they don't teach you in Flex/Flash/AS3 school.  And then consider the mixture of Flex and Flash all in one SWF !  Again, all part of knowing how to work with Flex and Flash.  Then give some thought to how great this site looks when you hit it with your Android phone's browser - again the experience is seamless and fluid.  Finally give some thought to the optimized JavaScript and CSS delivered by this site using optimized techniques - again this is all something every Fortune 100 company and up the chain should be salivating over because my sample site reduces bandwidth usage while increasing the speed of delivery for all that content.

Then again, give some thought to what someone like myself might be able to do with a reusable Web 2.0 Template that runs in the Google Cloud - sure it's a Blog now but it will be a Wiki tomorrow and a Storefront tomorrow with Social Networking support built-in just for fun.  All very easy to do, for me.  Self-help Kiosk for User Management - built-in.  Ability for users to build their own customized web pages, just like MySpace - coming soon.  Ability to write on each other's Walls - coming soon.  XMPP Support for chatting with friends - built-in by Google.  Automatic one-click deployment system to get people into their uber-site, coming soon.

There is no other reusable Site Template for the Google App Engine that does it all but there will be soon...  and it is 100% Open Source !
