"""
Welcome to the Code Comments for Simulate. Code Comments is a series of simple games with detailed comments in the source code, so you can see how the game works.

The text in between the triple-double-quotes are comments. The Python interpreter ignores any text in between them, so we can add any comments about the source code without affecting the program. In general for Code Comments, the comments will describe the lines of code above the comment. It helps to view this file either on the Code Comments site or with a text editor that does "syntax highlighting", so that the comments appear in a separate color and are easier to distinguish from the code.

This Code Comments assumes you know some basic Python programming. If you are a beginner and would like to learn computer programming, there is a free book online called "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" at http://inventwithpython.com

The Code Comments programs make references to sections of this book throughout the program. This Code Comments can also teach you how to use the Pygame library to make your own games with graphics, animation, and sound. You can download Pygame from http://pygame.org and view its documentation at http://pygame.org/docs/

HOW TO PLAY SLIDE PUZZLE
There are 15 tiles in a 4x4 grid. At the start of the game, the tiles are randomly switched around the board to generate a new puzzle. When the puzzle is ready, start sliding around the tilees to reorder the tiles.
"""

import pygame, sys, random, time
from pygame.locals import *
"""Here we import modules that our game needs. random has random number functions, time has the sleep() function, sys has the exit() function, and pygame contains all the pygame-related functions.

pygame.locals contains constants like MOUSEMOTION and MOUSEBUTTONUP and QUIT for the events. It's easier to type MOUSEBUTTONUP instead of pygame.locals.MOUSEBUTTONUP, so we use the "from pygame.locals import *" format to import these to the local namespace.

"""These constant variables (the uppercase names means we shouldn't change the values stored in them) set some standard values for our game. You can play around with different values for them (though some values might cause bugs in the game.) By using constants instead of the values directly, it is easier to make changes since we only have to change them in one place.

For example, if we used 80 instead of TILESIZE, then if we wanted to change our code later we'd have to change every place in the code we find 80. This is trickier than just changing the one line where MAXLIFE is originally set.

"""We also set up some constant values for different colors. Pygame uses tuples of three integers to represent color. The integers represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color (this is commonly called a RGB). 0 means there is none of the primary color in the color, and 255 means there is the maximum amount. So (255, 0, 0) is red, since it has the maximum amount of red but no green or blue. But (255, 0, 255) adds the max amount of blue with the red, creating purple.

But we also want to take into account the pixels in between the tiles. These gaps are one pixel in size each, and there are (COLS - 1) of them. So we subtract this value from the window width too.

The difference is if we make a typo using the strings, Python won't crash but it will still cause a bug. For instance, if we had this bit of code:
    if direction == 'dwon':
...then the program will still run, but it would contain a bug because if the direction variable was set to 'down', this condition would still evaluate to False (which is not how we'd want the code to behave).

But if we use constant values instead and make a similar typo:
    if direction == DWON:
...then Python crashes when it comes across this line because there is no such variable as DWON, just DOWN. Why is crashing a good thing? Well, it's not, but in this case it would immediately alert us that there is a problem, and we could fix it. If we had used a string instead, it might take a while to track down where the bug is caused. Using constants in this way helps us ensure that our program works correctly.

    More info on lists and list references can be found at http://inventwithpython.com/chapter10.html#ListReferences

    The [:] after sequence is technically a list slice. A slice is a sublist of the values in a list, much like an index just points to a single value in a list. For example, if we have this list:
        spam = [42, 10, 5, 100, 99]
    Then the index spam[2] refers to the integer 5 (remember, the indexes start a 0. 0 refers to the first item (42), 1 refers to the second item (10), 2 refers to the third itme (5), etc.)

    More info on slices and slicing can be found at http://inventwithpython.com/chapter9.html#SlicesandSlicing

    But a slice uses a colon to grab multiple values:
        eggs = spam[2:4]
    The above would put the list [5, 100] in the variable eggs. That is, it creates a new list and puts the values starting at (and including) index 2 and up to (but not including) the value at index 4. The integer before the colon is the starting index, and the integer after the colon is the ending index.

    If we leave out the first index in a slice, then Python interprets this as 0 (which is the first item.)
        bagels = spam[:4]
    The above line would put [42, 10, 5, 100] in the bagels variable.

    If we leave out the second index in a slice, then Python interprets this as meaning past the last index in the list:
        pancakes = spam[2:]
    The above line would put [5, 100, 99] in the pancakes variable.

    If we don't specify either index in a slice, then the ENTIRE list is copied. This is a quick way to copy a list, rather than just copying a list reference.
