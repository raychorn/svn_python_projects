      so a variable should prohibit this
  - Handling for linux root files (otherwise, they cannot be saved); called python programm again with gksudo to save that file
  - for that a new file drSaveRootFile.py was added
  - save file as: now per default suggests current filename

  - DrText EVT_CHAR: with eventhandler, DRPY_Event can be used
  - DrText EVT_KEY_DOWN: with eventhandler, DRPY_Event can be used

<Release Number=165>
(FS) ... Franz Steinhauesler
(AB) ... Antonio Barbosa
noteable in this release:
  - changed directory structure:
    drplugins and drscript dir is by default in preferences, but can be choosen to be somewhere else
    the structure of the data files:
    - prefsdir (preferences.dat, default.idx and drscript.dat)
      - "dat" (drpython.panel.sizes.dat, ...)
      - "shortcuts" (shortcuts.dat, stcshortcuts.dat, drscript.shortcuts.dat)
      - "plugins" (default.idx, the list of plugins loaded at startup)
        - "dat" (Plugins data and remembered state files)
        - "shortcuts" (plugin shortcut files)
        - "preferences" (plugin preferences files)
    please check your paths, if you update to version 165.
  - new project member (António Barbosa) abbreviated with AB. (contributed already a good fix, see below)
      (António Barbosa) is abbreviated with AB in changelog:
  - AB: Sourcebrowser with textfield for fast search.
  - AB: Sourcebrowser option: display source browser icons, default on (saves space, when turned on).
  - cleanup and removed some unnecessary code
  - removed simple/advanced mode.
(until) 07. Apr. 2007:
  - added notes.txt
  - little text display bug in drToolBarDialog (AB).
  - fix in StyleDialog (AB).
  - changed some default shortcuts to be more userfriendly (AB).
  - Added update function for users changing from 1.64 to 1.65 because of new directory structure (FS).
  - implemented new simple export/import preferences of drPyhton (AB).
  - changed some default preferences settings to be more userfriendly (AB).
(until) 23. Mar. 2007:
  - removed simple/advanced mode.
  - changed by AB: moved Generel Tab in Preferences to first tab.
  - fix by AB: (eliminate the call of initializing drScriptMenu twice.
  - fix by AB: on linux, output of prompt didn't appear (evt_idle do not work if the control has no focus; used a timer instead).
  - fix by AB: in drPrefsDialog.py: removed |wx.DD_NEW_DIR_BUTTON because the style wx.DD_DEFAULT_STYLE already includes  wx.DD_NEW_DIR_BUTTON
  - used sometimes 'u' to open text files with universal newline support (eliminates some problems with different lineendings (dos and linux))
25. Feb. 2007 - 01. Mar. 2007:
  - thanks antonio for testing.
  - plugins tested under windows and linux, wxpython unicode wxPython 2.8.1.1 and above for DrPython 1.65:
    (only listed plugins, I have in my local plugin directory; still some are missing in this list)
  - scrolledmessagedialog called with Showmessage only.
  - revert: revert changes "== None",  "!= None" to the former "is None" and "is not None" (many people said, this is not ok)
  - cleanup: run pychecker over all files, removed unneeded variables or names, unneeded import, fixed one or two bugs directly
             detected by pychecker.
  - cleanup: replaces the three lines in drscrolledmessage with a single ShowMessage.
  - changed: procedure of assigning userpreferences- und pluginsdir (take care, if drpyhton is started with --preferencesbasepath),
             and some other fixes with writing userpreferencesdirectory.dat and preferences.dat, handling of userpreferencesdirectory.
  - changed: split default.idx files for getting plugins. It should now work for both linux and windows for the same default.idx file.
  - fixed: always save and restore the current working directory (os.chdir and os.getcwd)
  - added: textfield and preference for defaultdirectory and store this in preferences.dat (I have changed it before unawared)
  - fixed: added fix by AB in EncodeTextWith(text, encoding), which caused problems with unicode in prompt (thanks Antonio).
  - removed: unnecessary print statements in code.
  - added tools directory for miscellanous stuff
  - run pyflakes and corrected/optimized some code.
24. Feb. 2007:
  - removed default directory in preferences
  - added user preferences dir: a file with the preferences dir will be created in the home folder
  - used plugin dir (was ignored until now)
  - used drscripts dir (was ignored until now); if a script is inside that dir,
      only relative path- and filename is stored, else the whole filename and path is stored
  - run pychecker on changed files
      * removed unneeded variables
      * detected a few bugs with pychecker
  - all files should be now with unix lineendings, spaces as indentation and trailing whitespaces are removed now.
  - new project member (António Barbosa) abbreviated with AB.
  - AB: fixed problem with PyDeadObjectError, when soure browser was closed by right click on the tab and choose close,
      and then try to reopen Sourcebrowser (drSourceBrowser.py).
  - cleanup the code, shortened to make it more clearly-presented:
      * for example in if no parenthises are needed if (a > b): => if a > b:
      * compare if string is empty: if len(teststring) > 0: => if teststring:
      * long lines breaked sometimes
      * self.scriptcount = self.scriptcount + 1 => self.scriptcount += 1
      * MessageDialog replaced by MessageBox (fewer lines)
  - is there a small bug in wxPython 2.8.1.1 compared to 2.6?:
      The edit script dialog was not fully visible anymore (no ok and cancel buttons)
      removed the setsize function therefore.
  - restriced trimtrailing whitespace only to python files.
  - removed unnecessary print statements.
  - drtext and drRegularExpressionDialog.py small bug fixed (which I checked in before)
  - while parenthesis removed: while (x < y): => while x < y:
  - AB: changed: in drpluginsdialog: (setnotindex) to keep old selection, which is not in index yet.

    The following small changes to drpython.py(w) provide the ability to give the names of files to edit as command line arguments.
  - applied patch from Knut Gerwens in CheckSyntax (drpython.py), many thanks.
      there was former a problem using unicode version of wxPython with encoding cookie
  - Patch by Knut Gerwens in drAboutDialog.py: added import of wx.lib.stattext,
     replaced all occurences of 'wx.StaticText' with 'wx.lib.stattext.GenStaticText'
     because wx.StaticText displayed some lines truncated when wxPython is run with wxGTK
  - Set first notebook tab of drAboutDialog to white Background.
  - added again menu entries: Edit => copy, cut, paste.
  - fixed bug in editing drscript menu (File: drScriptDialog.py) (shortcuts didn't fit anymore)

  - fixed error in drFileDialog.py (unicode string was not converted in string) and defaultencoding is now also used for linux.
  - renamed variable type to type_ in drFileDialog.py (type is a reserved keyword)
  - fixed annoying problem with unicode (added setdefaultencoding and wx.SetDefaultPyEncoding if a default encoding is set.
      (in drpython.py and if you change the encoding in drPrefsDialog.py).
      hack in linux reload(sys) otherwise, the setdefaultencoding is not available.
  - fixed bug in promptDir in DrPython.py: if dialog was cancelled, a traceback appeared (dir was not set).
  - AB: fixed bug in prompt with unicode: thanks!
  - split of default.idx (should work with lf and crlf now).
  - scrolledmessagedialog called with Showmessage only.
</Release>
<Release Number=163>
(Franz Steinhaeusler)
- I know there is much to do for linux, I'm looking for a project member (tester or even better bug fixer)
  for linux. I will request to sourceforge project help in the next few days/weeks anyway for that.
  There are some or many dialogs with bad layout, so not all texts are displayed, sizers are not fitting,
  crashes ...
  If you have interest please send me a mail or post into one of the foren.
  But nevertheless interesting, whether it runs on linux or are there some critical errors, and possible bug fixes?
  Best to send me whole files with an annotation, on what drpython release base you made your changes.
  With minmerge, that should be no problem, that I integrate them.
- 1.63 experimental; for careful people, please stay at 1.62 for the time being, for
    the other, please test
- plugin patches are also welcome
- there should be more menu icons visible.
- drpopup: icons in context menu (changes are older then one year)
- applied tab2spaces (for all py files in drpython, because it is python "standard")
- test and helper files added:
    dr.bat and d.bat
    drpython_wx26.pyw (test for older wxpython version)
    drpython_wx26_debug.pyw (test for older wxpython version and traceback output to file)
    drpython_wx26.py (test for older wxpython version)
    and 2 bat files
    if you use on of these, please rename then, adapt them to your needs and make a link to them.
    (because, this files will be overwritten in a newer version).
- encoding problems
  There was a problem in unicode build (for example german umlauts), that files are stored with 0 bytes.
  This is REALLY bad. I hope, this is resolved now (GetDefaultEncoding added).
  If there is still an error, the file will not be stored. you could copy/paste it to another editor.
  But I hope, this will never happen.
  applied also for decoding files.
- some "selfish" hacks integrated, which I want resolve in newer versions
  1) trim trailing whitespace only for python files, not for other files (I use the editor also in the company)
     Later, I want to add trim trailing whitespace to the file types
  2) removed copy/cut/paste from edit menu. For my keyboard macro plugin, otherwise, the keystrokes
     will not be recognised. Every people should know this commands by heart, anyway. :)
  3) I laid the ctr-right mouse click to my doclist plugin.
- drfiledialog sort "case insenstive".
- standard file dialog is standard again, not the drfiledialog (some people mourned about that).
- a bug in drNotebook.py fixed (bug report was also longer time ago).
- minimum panel size for source browser was restricted to 25 (unnecessary). put the value to 1.
    thanks for user request, Peter
- menu printer setup was not working, fixed.
- small fix in drPrompt.py
- new "hidden" feature: ctrl-right mouseclick should show the about dialog.
- small patch in drscripmenu.py
- workaround by Dunderhead, thanks. (self.txtPromptArray[i]._waitforoutput('>>>'), freezes on linux).
- small changes in RemoveTrailingWhitespace with status text output.
