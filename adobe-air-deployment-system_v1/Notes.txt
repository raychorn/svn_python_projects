My code can be packaged to detect if Adobe AIR Runtime is or is not installed.

If Adobe AIR Runtime is not installed then pop-up a dialog that tells the user where they can go to get the missing package - also pop-up a browser window, if possible.

If Adobe AIR Runtime is installed then attempt to install the AIR App and the Server.

After Air App has installed then start the server and launch the Air App.

If Air App cannot make a connection then display some info to tell the user how to start the Socket Server.


Alternative(s):

If Adobe AIR Runtime is not installed then Launch browser to a URL that detects if the AIR Runtime is not installed and installs it.


Design:

1). Detect and Install the Adobe AIR Runtime

2). Detect and Install the AIR App using a custom installation process.

3). Launch the AIR App via the Server that starts the AIR App before starting the Socket Server.


Reasons for embedding the Adobe AIR Runtime in the installer:

* Need to have the correct version of the runtime with the correct version of the Air App.


Reasons for downloading the Adobe AIR Runtime during the installer session:

* Need to make the installer as small as possible.
