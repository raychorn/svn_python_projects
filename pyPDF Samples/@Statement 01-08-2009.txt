In an effort to communicate urgent account information as quickly as possible, we are changing the way we deliver account notices to  
Online Banking customers for whom we have a valid email address. Starting January 17, 2010, we will send an email alert notifying you  
of an overdraft or insufficient funds notice in your secure online mailbox. These email alerts arrive up to three (3) days faster than paper  
notices, so you can resolve the situation more quickly and avoid additional fees. If you want to continue to receive notices by mail,  
please sign on to Online Banking, go to Delivery Preferences and select Online & U.S. Mail next to Account Notices, or contact us at  

Your Card (Wells Fargo ATM Cards, Check Cards, or Cash Cards) must not be used for any unlawful purpose (for example, funding any  
account that is set up to facilitate Internet gambling). You agree to take steps to ensure that you will not use your Card or any linked  
account for any transaction that is illegal under the laws governing your account. In addition, the Bank reserves the right to deny  
transactions or authorizations from merchants apparently engaging in the Internet gambling business or identifying themselves  
through the Card transactions record or otherwise as engaged in such business.
