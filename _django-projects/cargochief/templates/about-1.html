                    <p>Cargo Chief is partnering with brokers, load boards, aggregators and consolidators of trucking services to offer the best value in trucking for shippers with improved quality of service while assisting carriers to fill 28% of their trucks that are running empty.  Through direct relationships and aggregation, Cargo Chief can reach well over 100,000 trucks.  By checking the carrier against U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s strict Compliance, Safety and Accountability (CSA) requirements before they carry your valuable cargo, you know you are working with a rated carrier.</p>
