The idea here is to make a pyro Proxy that interfaces with the SVN Repo sitting in near-by.info such that 
a Django GUI is able to browse the SVN Repo to allow users to access the contents of the repo in a controlled
manner.

Q:  Is it necessary to serialize the pySVN accesses ?

A:  Probably not.  svn+ssh does not require serialized accesses.
