<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>
  <A target="pyca_demo" HREF="http://sites.inka.de/ms/cgi-bin/pyca/ca-index.py">
  ca-index.py</A> shows CA index of the <A HREF="conf/openssl.cnf">example
  configuration file</A>. You can download CA certificates and CRLs of
  my <em>TestCA</em> and call the application form for generating
  certificate requests.
</p>
<p>
  Please make backup copies of your certificate database and key files
  (e.g. <em>cert7.db</em> and <em>key3.db</em> in your Netscape's profile
  directory) <strong>before</strong> playing around with the CA certificates
  and CRLs.
</p>
<p>
  Only the <em>Persona</em> CA is meant for playing with
  client-side key generation with
  <A target="pyca_demo" HREF="http://sites.inka.de/ms/cgi-bin/pyca/client-enroll.py">
  client-enroll.py</A>
  and sending certificate requests. All other
  CA types are dedicated to my personal use.
</p>
<p>
  To all hacker wanna-be's:
  There are <strong>no private keys on this server</strong>!
