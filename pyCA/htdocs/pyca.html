<h2><A NAME="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>
  The usage of cryptographic techniques promises secure usage of
  Internet services concerning authentication of clients and servers and
  authorized access to sensitive data. During the last two years it turned
  out that X.509 certificates, SSL and S/MIME are the relevant, widely
  adopted cryptographic standards for securing various Internet services
  like WWW, Mail, etc.
</p>
<p>
  However these standards require setting up a working X.509-based PKI
  (pulic key infrastructure).
  Although there is a quite lot of documentation and some example software
  for setting up a primitive PKI with an own certificate authority
  with the free package <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>
  it seems that this task is not easy for most people. There is a lot of
  discussion on various mailing-lists, e.g. how to generate self-signed
  CA certificates, generate certificate requests with the famous WWW browsers and how to provide
  client certificates / certificate revocation lists for download, etc.
  Additionally if the certification business of an organization gets only a
  little bit more serious one has to take care about critical security issues.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.pyca.de/">pyCA</a> tries to make it
  easier for people to set up and run a organizational certificate authority
  which fulfills the need for a fairly secure certification processing.
  The package also tries to reduce administrative tasks and user's frustration
  by providing a comfortable web interface to users contacting the certificate
  authority.

<h2>Project status</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately I do not have the time at the moment to spend more time
on developing this project. I will apply bug fixes and patches submitted
by users as long as they do not require too much rewriting of code.
